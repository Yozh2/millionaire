# Megatron Origin Overview

The Transformers: Megatron Origin is a 4-issue mini-series published by IDW Publishing in 2007, set in the 2005 IDW continuity. It details the rise of Megatron from a lowly Energon miner to the leader of the Decepticons. Also introduced is Autobot leader, Sentinel Prime and his quest to halt Megatron's actions.

In the 2005 IDW timeline, the story takes place in the distant past, somewhere in between the launch of the first Ark (6.7 million years ago) and the events of Spotlight: Shockwave (less than a million years ago). This miniseries is noteworthy for having been originally planned during the not-paying-the-hired-help last days of Dreamwave, and only later retooled to fit the new IDW continuity.

It was reprinted in Titan's Transformers magazine from #14. It came included with a disclaimer telling kids that this "Generation 1" was a different version of the Transformers they knew.

Senator Decimus is sent to announce the automation of an Energon mining outpost, much to the chagrin of the miners. When one of the workers protests, he is executed by an Autobot security official, sparking a riot. An enraged miner named Megatron tosses his axe into Decimus' shoulder and disarms his guard, accidentally killing him. The Autobot guards subdue the riot and arrest everyone. On the prison vessel, Rumble and Frenzy convince Megatron to lead a revolt. After taking over their ship, they blast the Senator's ship and head towards the criminal hub of Kaon where the miners hide and plot. Sentinel Prime becomes aware of the situation but is uninterested and appoints Prowl to handle the situation.

Megatron joins underground gladiatorial combat games and hesitates to kill his first opponent, but does so after being ordered by the ring master and the audience. After getting accustomed to the kill, Megatron rises through the ranks and eventually kills the organizer and takes over. The games come to the attention of the corrupt and manipulative Senator Ratbat. Predicting a profitable situation, he sends his assistant to meet with Megatron. The games are also being watched by Prowl's team, who are eager to put a stop to the unlawful violence. Sentinel Prime arrives and announces that there have already been several efforts in a plan to catch the delinquents.

During a stakeout for the next gladiatorial match, Bumper and Fastback observe the Constructicons building the arena. Soundwave approaches Megatron and offers him technology and weaponry at the behest of Ratbat. The two Autobots witness the transaction but are killed. At their funeral, Sentinel Prime emphasizes that their deaths should serve as a call to action, and that to give them meaning he will bring the outlaws to justice.

Soundwave meets with Megatron after a match where Megatron lost an arm in combat. The Constructicons replace the arm with parts taken from fallen gladiators, as well as installing his energon flail. Soundwave more than fulfills Megatron's request for a flight-capable combatant, bringing him the three original Seekers. Megatron says he has something in store for them besides gladiatorial matches, and turns the Seekers over to Hook for modification.

During a parade for Senator Decimus, the Seekers disrupt the festivities and abduct the Senator. Senator Ratbat watches footage of a series of daring and destructive attacks and comments that things are getting out of control. Meanwhile, Rumble and Frenzy are modified to work with Soundwave as Megatron gathers new recruits to join the gladiator games. At the meeting, Megatron praises the recruits and tempts them with the prospect of the whole planet as their arena. Prepared to kill the captured Senator Decimus, he is interrupted by Sentinel Prime's forces and the whole lot is captured and arrested.

At the crowded cells in headquarters, Soundwave is freed under a Senate Directive and Starscream offers to turn state's evidence, requesting to be taken to the Senate. Once there, Starscream unveils hidden weapons and Soundwave deploys his minions to destroy the council. Starscream then frees all the inmates with Megatron absorbing them all into his new army. Soundwave provides armaments, and Starscream introduces Megatron to a new arm-mounted cannon.

Soundwave meets with Senator Ratbat, who admits that not only did he aid Megatron's cause by supplying arms, he also was the one who arranged for Megatron to be removed from the mining operation he was originally working in. Now that Megatron's forces have destabilized the area, the senator embezzles what he can. Soundwave, however, shoots Ratbat, takes that which Ratbat has embezzled, and seals his spark inside of a frame—his new "cassette" body.

Sentinel Prime's forces fight to retake Kaon from the rioting rebellion and Prime uses the Apex Armor against Megatron. An incredible explosion blasts Megatron out of sight. However, Megatron still functions and he smashes Prime, possibly killing him. When the other Autobots see his broken body, Prowl orders a retreat. Megatron later sits on his throne and discusses the victory with Soundwave. Now that Kaon has been taken, the next step is clear—the rest of Cybertron shall be conquered.

Creative team
Megatron Origin was written by Eric Holmes and drawn by Alex Milne, with assistance on issue #2 by Marcelo Matere.

Notes
It should be noted, that–as revealed by Eric Holmes himself–Megatron: Origin was originally intended to be set in Dreamwave Generation 1 continuity. However, Dreamwave's bankruptcy put an end to this plan. After IDW decided to have the comic written and drawn, the script was truncated from 6 issues to 4 issues. Missing scenes would have featured a 'mentor' character whom Megatron meets and bonds with before he becomes a gladiator. Writer James Roberts would later massage this idea into the continuity with Terminus.
In various interviews, Holmes would state that part of the idea was that people don't choose to be villains. In one interview for the series, he would say "one of the key things about the story" is Megatron and violence: "he experiences it, then finds out that he likes it and that he can make a good living through exploiting it."[1]
Simon Furman gave the story a look and helped Holmes edit it to be a better fit with IDW.[2]

## Synopsis

Four million years ago, Senator Decimus and his assistant arrive at the run-down colony of Mining Outpost C-12 to deliver a formal message to the employees who call the outpost home: as part of the Cybertronian Senate 's efforts to cut costs, the energon mine will be automated, leaving its workers jobless. This doesn't bother Decimus one iota as he prepares the assembly to deliver the bad news: his disdain for the working-class personnel who operate the mine is quite clear, and he's more than eager to see them replaced.

During the assembly, Decimus' announcement naturally goes down poorly with his audience, despite his efforts to assuage their fears by pointing out that the laborers will not be left without jobs. One particularly angry 'bot, aware that the Senate's rampant automation will soon leave the working class destitute, speaks out, and is immediately executed by one of Decimus's Autobot security officers.

The crowd is briefly silenced by this display of force, and Decimus tries to restore order until one worker, an upstart named Megatron , makes his opinion very clear by flinging his axe into Decimus's shoulder. Before the security officer can react, Megatron tackles and disarms him; the two struggle until Megatron gains the upper hand — and accidentally kills his opponent.

As Megatron struggles to come to terms with what he's just done, the rest of the miners, encouraged by his example, quickly charge the Senator's position... only to be swiftly overpowered, incapacitated, and arrested by Autobot riot control.

Megatron and his fellow miners come to aboard the transport shuttle Longshot en route to a detention center ; as soon as he awakens Megatron is approached by Rumble and Frenzy . Despite their enthusiasm, Megatron is still perturbed by his actions and wants no part in their plans. But as the rowdy duo set about distracting the guards, Megatron finds himself drawn to the vanguard of the rebellion as the ex-miners easily overwhelm their captors and seize the ship.

Aboard Decimus's shuttle, the Senator and his entourage are none the wiser about this revolt until the Longshot breaks formation, blasting the Senator's vessel and stranding the ship and its occupants in deep space; this is a deliberate ploy on Megatron's part to distract the Autobots with a rescue mission, leavin the rebels free to plot a new course back to Cybertron unhindered. Arriving over the city of Kaon , the "worst place on Cybertron," the miners opt to lay low for the time being, confident in the knowledge that they've given the Senate more important things to worry about.

In Kaon's Security Services Headquarters , Sentinel Prime finishes up a round of target practice before he's interrupted by his second-in-command Prowl , who comes bearing news of the incident in space. The Prime , uninterested in the dealings of the Senate and its constituents, appoints Prowl to handle the issue — but neither of them are aware that the perpetrators have successfully landed on Cybertron and escaped into Kaon's criminal underbelly...

# Megatron Origin issue 2

## Synopsis

Since returning to Cybertron , Megatron and his motley group of rebellious miners have made new lives for themselves as gladiators, competing in the illegal pit fights that take place in the Forge , deep in the bowels of crime-ridden Kaon . In his very first match, Megatron finds himself up against a particularly durable foe , who shrugs off Megatron's initial attempts to impale him. He has the upper hand until Megatron uses his alternate mode as a weapon, harnessing its weight and mass to crush his opponent and run him over. As the other gladiator lies helpless on the floor, Megatron seems ready to end the fight, much to the confusion of the audience watching... until Clench , the ringmaster of these games, orders Megatron to finish the fight by killing him. Though briefly haunted by his memory of taking his first life back on Mining Outpost C-12 , Megatron grabs the other gladiator's spear and uses it to fatally stab him, basking in the adulation of the crowd.

Meanwhile, Senator Ratbat dismisses the concerns of his meager assistant to attend to more important matters. A thoroughly corrupt member of the Cybertronian Senate , Ratbat lives on the upper echelons of society, and uses his wealth and connections to easily manipulate planetary events for his personal gain. During his latest session, however, Ratbat is intrigued by a report on the illegal gladiator games sweeping Cybertron, and sends his servant to investigate...

As the days pass, Megatron swiftly rises through the ranks of the bloodsports and eventually finds himself fighting alongside Clench. In one such match, Clench's team is up against the wall, giving Megatron the perfect opportunity to take advantage of Clench's momentary distraction to fatally stab the gladiatorial leader and take over.

The coup doesn't go unnoticed by Cybertronian law enforcement, who are increasingly worried about the rise of these illegal fights, the increasing prominence of Megatron's team, and their inability to find the arenas where these illicit activities take place. At Kaon's Security Services Headquarters , Prowl shows footage of the battle to his team, who are eager to put a stop to the unlawful violence—a sentiment shared by Sentinel Prime , who arrives and announces his plan to nail the gladiators in a wide-ranging police operation: a plan that will require the assistance of every Autobot officer in Kaon.

Eighteen cycles later, Cybertronian Security officers Bumper and Fastback stake out a location suspected to be the grounds for the next game. Bored with the work, their patience is rewarded when the Constructicons arrive: the gladiators aren't shipping parts to set up their mobile arenas, they're building them on-site... using parts obtained from hapless vagrants like Wheezel , who finds himself thrown into a smelting pool , his metal melted down to become the rivets and plates required to refit the abandoned venue into a suitable arena. No sooner have they finished then Soundwave turns up—a new convert to the cause who, on the behalf of his employer, offers the recently arrived Megatron an array of black market weaponry, provided that Megatron uses them as he "sees fit."

The two Autobots witness this exchange, but aren't so lucky when Megatron realizes that he's being eavesdropped on. Though the Autobots try to call for backup, they're immediately ambushed and incapacitated by Soundwave's partners: Ravage , Laserbeak , and Buzzsaw .

Bumper awakens to see Megatron stomping Fastback flat, before the gladiatorial leader turns his attention to Bumper. Bumper refuses to give in to Megatron's interrogation, and so Soundwave deploys Laserbeak—a "specialist"—to pry the necessary data from Bumper's mind. Realizing that they've been compromised, Megatron realizes that he'll have to scuttle the arena. Pleased with Soundwave's services, however, he agrees to do business with Soundwave's master... and then ties up the last loose end by crushing Bumper to death.

# Megatron Origin issue 3

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Megatron_Origin_issue_3 -->

## Synopsis

In Kaon , Soundwave arrives at Megatron 's gladiatorial safehouse with a message. Swindle advises him to tread lightly; their leader has just lost an arm from his latest pit fight , and the Constructicons are busily replacing it with one culled from a casualty of the fight.

Soundwave brings good news: he has made progress on Megatron's request for a flight -capable operative. In fact, he's outdone Megatron's request: he's found three new converts to the cause, all of them capable of flight: Starscream , Thundercracker , and Skywarp . Starscream is awed in the presence of the famous gladiator and prostrates himself, swearing undying allegiance. After questioning them on their capabilities, Megatron announces that he has something in store for them besides gladiatorial matches. Deploying his new suite of weaponry, he turns the trio over to the ministrations of Hook , for modification...

Elsewhere in Kaon, the Cybertron Security Forces hold a funeral for Fastback and Bumper , killed in action following their disastrous confrontation with Megatron's forces. Sentinel Prime delivers the eulogy. He emphasizes that their deaths should serve as a call to action, and that to give their deaths meaning he will bring the outlaws to justice. Some time later, a parade is held for the unveiling of a new statue, commemorating the service of Senator Decimus . It all goes well until the three Seekers disrupt the festivities; Skywarp uses his teleportation abilities to abduct the Senator and spirit him away to places unknown. This first attack emboldens Megatron's cause; from his office, Senator Ratbat watches footage of the increasingly daring and destructive attacks, and realizes that his plans might have gotten too far out of hand.

His cause now in the ascendant, Megatron puts out a call for new recruits to join the gladiator games; though Sunstreaker considers joining, his brother Sideswipe advises against it — watching the fights is one thing, but joining them another thing entirely. The Predacons express scorn about the influx of "amateurs" but quickly retract the claim as Grimlock and the Dynobots throw their hats into the ring. Backstage, Rumble and Frenzy protest being placed under Soundwave's command, but Megatron states that they have been modified for a reason. Ignoring their protests, Megatron takes the stage and whips his crowd of new arrivals into a frenzy — stoking their egos by unveiling the Decepticon insignia as the heraldry of his new movement, telling his audience that they're the most dangerous Transformers on the planet, and tempting them with the promise of turning all of Cybertron into their arena — before ordering his Seekers to bring out Senator Decimus, intending to execute the helpless Senator.

Before he can do so, however, their clandestine meeting is interrupted by the Autobot Security Services, led by Prowl and Sentinel Prime. Megatron, his inner circle, and everyone the Autobots can catch are clapped in inhibitor claws and captured. Back at their headquarters , Sentinel Prime, already frustrated by the massive influx of prisoners, is upset by the news that, under Senate directive, Soundwave will walk free. As the rest of Megatron's cadre bicker with one another in their holding cell, Starscream offers to turn state's evidence in exchange for his own freedom. Though Megatron tries to order his legions to kill Starscream, the Decepticon is escorted out of his cell, promising that his evidence will guarantee both their future and his own...

# Megatron Origin issue 4

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Megatron_Origin_issue_4 -->

## Synopsis

Having been arrested and detained by Sentinel Prime 's Autobot security forces, Megatron 's forces are in a tight squeeze, literally and metaphorically - their presence threatens to push the holding capacity of Kaon 's Security Services Headquarters to the limit, and Starscream is marched away from the other imprisoned gladiators, seemingly to turn in his fellow rebels.

Starscream is taken before the Kaon Council to testify. As the assembled 'bots read out a list of charges, the Seeker remains flippant, raising the ire of the prosecutors, before finally offering his own two cents: everything that has happened is their fault. Raising his weapons, he and Soundwave easily destroy their would-be captors in a final coup de grace against the old order, and etch their symbol into the meeting room's view screen.

From their cells, the other prisoners hear the bloodshed, and Megatron is pleased: he'd deliberately engineered the entire arrest and Starscream's seeming defection in order to easily slaughter his assembled enemies. Starscream releases his leader and his gladiator crew, who are swiftly joined by every other criminal in the building. With Soundwave providing armaments and badges to the new recruits, Starscream introduces Megatron to the most devastating weapon in the precinct's armory: a new, arm-mounted fusion cannon . Blasting a hole in the wall with his new weapon, Megatron orders the group to attack with an offensive that is as simple as it is destructive: everything burns.

Aboard a pleasure vessel filled with Cybertron 's upper class , snooty recreation comes to an end when Megatron's forces launch an attack. Though Thundercracker is uncertain, his partner Skywarp goads him into firing upon the leisure ship, causing it to crash into the city below in a fiery conflagration.

As Kaon burns, Sentinel and the other Autobots fight to retake the city from the insurgents, but it's an uphill fight all the way: the rebels have caused massive damage, jammed communications with Iacon , and refuse to give an inch of ground. With his options running out, Sentinel realizes that he'll have to deploy the "Apex" as his final contingency plan, ordering his soldiers to hold the line while he falls back to retrieve it.

While Megatron and his troops lead the assault on Kaon, Soundwave meets with his boss, Senator Ratbat . The smug Senator admits that he was behind the disastrous chain of events that led to Megatron's rise to power: not only did he aid Megatron's cause by supplying arms, he was also the one who arranged for Megatron to be removed from the mining operation where he was originally working—and now that Megatron's forces have destabilized the area, the senator is embezzling what he can before moving on to new pastures. Soundwave, however, shoots his former boss, takes Ratbat's ill-gotten gains, and prepares to seal his spark inside a new frame...

As he struggles to get to the front lines, Megatron's advance is briefly halted by a colossal explosion: an explosion that was caused by Sentinel Prime, sealed inside a colossal suit of Apex Armor and ready to throw down with his opposite number. Another salvo of firepower throws the rebel leader off his feet. Believing his enemy dead, Sentinel radios to the other Autobots that he's created an opening in the enemy lines... but learns that he's spoken too soon when Megatron rises once more, using Hound 's body as a bludgeon to shatter the helmet of the Apex Armor.

Their struggle takes them over a precipice as they battle while discussing Megatron's goal: Megatron will transform the world by tearing it all down, and Sentinel seeks to uphold the old order from any treachery. The two grapple until Megatron is almost knocked over a precipice; as Sentinel lifts him up to deliver the final strike, Megatron gains a second wind and launches a savage counterattack against the Autobot leader, mortally wounding him. Haivng finally made contact with Iacon, more Autobot reinforcements arrive... just in time to see their leader's broken body lying in a crater. Prowl , assuming command, orders a retreat.

As dawn breaks, Megatron takes stock of his latest victory and the journey that led him to this point. Having fashioned a throne from the remains of the Apex Armor, he discusses his next moves with Soundwave. Now that Kaon has been taken, the next step is clear—the rest of Cybertron shall be conquered. But they will not do it as Cybertronians. From this day forward, they are the Decepticons .

The Great War has begun...
