## Synopsis

Spike Witwicky finds his father, "Sparky" Witwicky , asleep in a bar. Spike asks his father how long he's been there, to which Danny , the bartender, answers that he has been there since noon. Sparky notices that Spike has his brother Jimmy 's telescope with him. Spike tells him that he and Carly plan to visit Hanger's Rock to see the full moon. He says it helps him remember Jimmy, to which Sparky grouses that it's better to forget. Spike fires back at his father, telling him he won't end up like Jimmy. Meanwhile, another patron drunkenly ranted about seeing a giant boxy jet fly down from space. Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Sparky's co-worker, Davey , who is here to pick him up for their shifts. Sparky tells Spike that he has to grow up eventually, to which Spike angrily asks if he means being like him. As the adults drive off, Carly arrives to pick Spike up in her van. Carly consoles a dejected Spike by suggesting they "pretend they're on another planet".

The pair climbs the mountain at Hanger's Rock for a better view and to discuss their future ambitions. Spike recently has been accepted to the University of California, Berkeley , where he wishes to follow in Jimmy's footsteps and become an astronaut. However, he's reluctant to tell his father about it since Jimmy's death. Carly, meanwhile, has been looking at art schools, but she and her father are struggling to make it work financially. Carly takes Spike's hand, telling him how sorry she is about what's going on with his family. As the two teenagers lean in closer, an earthquake shakes the ground, causing the mountain to split open and sending the two plummeting into the depths below. Recovering, they find themselves inside a giant circular structure — the booster of a gigantic spacecraft . Spike ventures further inside the starship and sees the primary control room, littered with the mangled bodies of what appears to be some giant robots.

Jetfire flies into the Ark and transforms, grateful to have found his fallen friends. He activates Teletraan One to repair and reconstruct his fellow Cybertronians, granting them new forms he found on Earth . The first reactivated is Starscream . Jetfire warmly greets his old friend, having not seen him in centuries. Starscream thanks Jetfire for waking him and says he's glad he "picked the right side" before immediately turning to the nearby Bumblebee and blasting his head off. The stunned Jetfire, unaware that their people have been at war for the past hundred years, tries to stop him, but Starscream turns his null-ray on his old friend for opposing. Starscream aims his weapon at Jazz next, but a reconstructed Optimus Prime stops him!

As the Autobot leader and Decepticon warrior fight, Prime notices the humans and instinctively dives to protect them from Starscream's fire. Ratchet 's intervention halts Starscream's attack right as Teletraan One reconstructs Skywarp . Realizing the computer is reconstructing them randomly, Starscream tells Skywarp to bring their fellow Decepticons closer. Optimus realizes that the Decepticons will outnumber them and orders a retreat, telling Ratchet to load their fellow Autobots into his new form's trailer while he fends off their opponents. When he reaches for his ion blaster , a revived Soundwave intercepts him with cannon fire. As he recovers, he sees Bumblebee's remains, cradling him in despair before being beset by Starscream and Ravage . Seeing this, Spike and Carly run out and push Prime's blaster to him, allowing him to fight back.

Left with no choice, Optimus fires at Teletraan One, destroying the computer and preventing the remaining Decepticons from being reconstructed. As Teletraan explodes, Optimus grabs Carly and Spike. He and Ratchet transform and drive out of the Ark into the mountains below, Starscream and Skywarp in hot pursuit despite their low energon levels. Jetfire regains consciousness and follows them, firing on Starscream, much to his regret. Starscream volleys back, critically wounding Jetfire. Fortunately for the Autobots, Skywarp's energy reserves dwindled, forcing the Seekers to retreat.

Needing to recuperate, Spike leads the Autobots to an abandoned quarry. As he succumbs to his injuries, Jetfire apologizes to Optimus; so much has changed since he left Cybertron in hopes of saving it. Optimus tries to use the Matrix of Leadership to heal Jetfire, but Ratchet tells him that his injuries are too extreme. Optimus grips his old friend's hand as he passes, lamenting his failure.

In the Ark , Soundwave reports to Starscream that he cannot fix Teletraan One, as they lack the necessary energon and raw materials. They are the only Decepticons left until it's repaired. Soundwave has already sent Laserbeak to scout for possible energon sources, but harvesting it falls to Starscream since he has the most energon reserved. Begrudgingly, Starscream accepts. After all, he is the leader of the Decepticons now.

As Davey and Sparky end their shift at the nearby power plant, Davey tries to talk to Sparky about his recent troubles, but they are interrupted by the arrival of Starscream, irritated he has to be the one doing all the work. The pair try to escape, but Starscream notices them. Sparky hides inside the plant while the giant alien snatches up Davey. Starscream smiles as he crushes Davey in his hand, amused at how fragile, squishy, and pathetic the humans are.

# Transformers (2023) issue 2

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_2 -->

## Synopsis

Optimus Prime walks through a wood, marveling at the natural beauty of Earth. The plants, the animals, the scenery; he finds it all breathtaking. However, his serenity is interrupted upon hearing a crunch underneath his foot: he's stepped on a small deer , killing it. Optimus leans down, cradling the creature with remorse. Spike emerges from the woods and reassures Optimus that it was an accident. Optimus tells Spike that this world is so fragile compared to his own. Seeing the Autobot leader's despair, Spike decides to change the subject of the conversation and asks Optimus about his name. Optimus tells him that the Prime title denotes him as leader of the Autobots and was passed to him by the previous leader of their kind. Optimus in turn inquires about Spike's name, who reveals that his mom used to call him "Spikey" before she passed away due to his hair always sticking up as a child. Optimus is confused; he’s never heard the terms "mom" or "dad" before, though he does know the concept of "family." Spike then asks Optimus about where he comes from, prompting Optimus to tell him about Cybertron and the war between the Autobots and Decepticons that has raged for the past two centuries. The Autobots' forces eventually dwindled from the Decepticons' relentless onslaught to the point where they were forced to flee the planet aboard the Ark . However, their escape was attacked by Megatron and the Decepticons. The last thing Optimus saw before they crashed into the mountain was Earth. Optimus thanks Spike for assisting him during the battle, saying that he's not sure they would have escaped without him. Spike in turn offers condolences for Bumblebee .

Their somber heart-to-heart is soon interrupted by the newly reactivated Cliffjumper , whom Ratchet was able to successfully repair. Optimus warmly greets his old friend, but Cliffjumper is not nearly as taken with Earth as his commander, freaking out upon seeing Spike and Carly and bumping into the trees. Carly tells him to calm down. After all, if anyone should be freaking out about the giant robots from space, it's her. This gets Cliffjumper to calm down and the two shake hands. Inside the quarry, Ratchet has set about trying to revive the other Autobots, but has used up the last of their energon reserves fixing Cliffjumper. Optimus considers using the Matrix of Leadership to replenish their energon, but Ratchet says they can't. The Matrix is connected to Prime's own life force and if they lose him, they lose everything. Cliffjumper remarks that if they're running out of energon, the Decepticons will hopefully have the same problem.

Meanwhile, at the power plant Sparky and Davey work at, a police officer is surveying the damage caused by Starscream 's attack and taking statements, not believing the plant manager 's story about a giant robot. The officer says they'll get some detectives out here to investigate, but a panicked Sparky insists they need to call in the Army. As the officer tries to reassure Sparky, Skywarp drops from the sky, destroying his patrol car. Behind him descend Starscream and Soundwave carrying an energy transfer module stolen from the Ark , which will allow them to more efficiently convert energon from the plant. The police officer tries to shoot at Starscream, much to Sparky's protests, only for Starscream to step on him. As the Decepticons begin to drain the plant of its energy, Soundwave intercepts a transmission from the U.S. military asking a nearby pilot under the callsign " Frosting " to intercept their attack. Amused at the idea of the "squishies" trying to fight them, Starscream goes to intercept the fighter. He dogfights with them for a bit before transforming and smacking the jet down. The pilot and his ride-along eject, but Starscream catches up to Frosting and squashes him between his hands. The other soldier activates a button on his parachute, converting it into a winged jetpack. As Starscream advances, he pulls out his flare gun and fires at the Decepticon, getting a lucky shot at his eye before retreating. Starscream opts to give up on the minor annoyance and Duke flies away to fight another day.

Back at the plant, Sparky takes one of the patrol cars as he is chased down by Skywarp. Before he can catch the human, however, Frosting's F-18 comes crashing down on top of him and Soundwave, allowing Sparky to slip away. The resulting explosion is seen by the Autobots and Carly and Spike realize that the plant is under attack. Feeling responsible for bringing their war to this planet, Optimus opts to face the Decepticons, despite Ratchet's protest about their need to find their own energy sources. Optimus assigns Cliffjumper to stay with Ratchet and protect their sleeping comrades. Spike decides to come along to help his dad, which Optimus reluctantly allows. Carly tries to stop him, saying they need to get back home to their parents, but Spike insists. She decides to leave for home alone. As she drives back towards town, she is spotted by Laserbeak , who identifies the image of Optimus Prime Carly drew on her van earlier that day. She arrives home to find Sparky already there, dressed in his old Army fatigues and carrying several guns. Carly asks where her dad is, and Sparky answers that "they" killed him; Davey is dead.

# Transformers (2023) issue 3

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_3 -->

## Synopsis

Learning her father has been killed, Carly asks Sparky how it happened, and Sparky tells her he was crushed by a giant robot. Carly realizes it must have been Starscream and begins to tell Sparky about her and Spike's discovery of the Ark . Sparky desperately asks where Spike is when they are attacked by Laserbeak . Sparky fires at the robot bird, only to get tossed around the room for his efforts. Laserbeak then corners Carly, but she is rescued by the timely arrival of Cliffjumper , who delivers a swift kick to Laserbeak's face. As Cliff approaches Carly, however, Sparky yells at him to get away before firing a shotgun at the Autobot 's face. Carly tries to get him to stop, but Sparky pulls her into the police car he commandeered and they drive off.

In the Ark , an irritated Starscream berates Soundwave for not fixing Teletraan 1 . Soundwave tells him that while they have enough energon , the raw materials they gathered aren’t advanced enough to repair the computer. When Soundwave begins to mention what Megatron would do, Starscream slaps him, repeating his order to not say his name. Soundwave receives an alert from Laserbeak and Starscream orders Skywarp to deal with it.

Sparky takes Carly to the veterans' bar. Carly asks why they’re there and Sparky tells her that the Decepticons are jamming all phone, radio, and internet signals, so they need reinforcements from somewhere. Inside, Danny and a group of other veterans have heard the explosions and already formed a small militia to defend themselves. Carly tries to tell Sparky that they aren't all bad, but Sparky says that he's been in war: when the shooting starts, people die. At that moment, Cliffjumper appears in the doorway and Sparky unloads a machine gun on him. Skywarp then arrives, which the humans mistake for Cliffjumper having called in reinforcements, and they begin firing on both. On the outskirts of town, Optimus and Spike see smoke coming from the battle and Optimus quickly heads in to intervene. With Skywarp shaking off the humans' bullets like they're nothing, Danny decides they need something bigger: he and Sparky pull out a bazooka before the bar caves in on itself. Skywarp approaches Cliffjumper for the kill, but Carly tries to step in and defend him, much to Skywarp's amusement. The pair are saved by the timely intervention of Optimus, who rams into Skywarp in his truck mode. Optimus transforms and tells Spike to take cover while he deals with the Decepticon.

The two fight, Skywarp using his teleportation and Optimus using his energon-axe . Optimus pins Skywarp down and asks him to surrender, but their fight is interrupted by Sparky and Danny firing the bazooka at Optimus, severely damaging his right arm. This allows Skywarp to regain his footing and blast Optimus back. Sparky tells the militia to pour their fire on both of the Cybertronians as Spike runs towards the wounded Optimus… getting caught in the crossfire. Skywarp taunts Optimus as he moves to crush Spike, but Optimus tackles him to the ground. In a moment of desperation, Prime tears off his injured arm, using it as a club to beat Skywarp down. He then picks up Spike, now bleeding profusely from his injury. Sparky runs towards Prime, tears streaking his face and a handgun pointed at the Autobot leader, screaming at him to get away from his son. Optimus transforms and tells Sparky to come with him; he’s going to save his boy.

# Transformers (2023) issue 4

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_4 -->

## Synopsis

With the smoke from the battle in Farmingham still fresh, Starscream arrives to confront the severely-damaged Skywarp about the whereabouts of the Autobots . Skywarp directs Starscream east, after which the Decepticon leader departs, promising to return for Skywarp.

At the quarry, Ratchet is working on Wheeljack when he receives a call for aid from Optimus Prime , who is driving Sparky and the mortally-wounded Spike through the woods with Starscream hot on his tail. A blast from Starscream damages Optimus and cuts off the transmission, and Ratchet bemoans that his buddy's gonna have to wait... the Autobots need firepower. Back with the chase, Starscream lands in front of Optimus, only for Carly and Cliffjumper to emerge from hiding and knock the Decepticon off his feet, allowing Optimus to run over Starscream and escape with Cliff. Enraged, Starscream calls Soundwave for backup.

Our heroes soon arrive at the Farmingham Hospital, only for Laserbeak to swoop in and barrage the group. Optimus and Cliff cover Sparky, Carly, and the medical staff as they rush Spike inside, but the Autobots are quickly caught off-guard by Rumble and Soundwave. The latter prepares to execute Optimus, only for the arriving Starscream to tell him to wait — he's just realized, to his amusement, that this place is where the "squishy ones" go to get fixed, and has decided to make Optimus' death even more painful by blasting his precious humans' only hope of survival to smithereens. Inside, the doctors barely get Spike intubated before Starscream's assault begins, knocking the power offline. As Starscream relishes in the destruction he's causing, Soundwave alerts him to the impending approach of Ratchet and the "firepower" he's managed to bring back online — Jazz ! The Decepticons focus their firepower on the new arrival as he drifts into action, but Jazz proves too slippery for them, and he quickly takes them down. Now outnumbered, Starscream orders Soundwave and the cassettes to retreat. Carly returns as the battle concludes, and Optimus asks her about Spike…

The Autobots look on through a hole in the hospital as the doctors inform Sparky that although Spike has been stabilized, the hospital's backup generator was evidently a casualty of the battle, and without power, Spike — along with the hospital's other life support patients — are all but guaranteed to die. Just as Sparky begins to mourn the loss of another son, however, a bright blue glow begins emanating from Optimus' opened chest compartment. Ratchet attempts to dissuade Optimus, but he won't have any of it — he's determined to prevent more deaths at any cost, removing the Matrix of Leadership from his chest and opening it up, the energy within re-powering the hospital. Relieved and in awe, the doctors hurry to get Spike to the I.C.U..

Meanwhile, the Decepticons, including Skywarp, return to the Ark . Soundwave berates Starscream for another failure, criticizing his shortsightedness and lust for destruction, and Starscream swiftly snaps back, upset that Soundwave hasn't been able to repair Teletraan One so they can finally bring their brothers back online and facilitate repairs. Soundwave reiterates that they don't have the materials they need to do so, as they only exist in Cybertronian technology. As he says this, the two turn to Skywarp... and then, despite his protests, begin tearing him apart.

Back at the hospital, Sparky talks to the comatose Spike about his desire to restart the family's lives and protect Spike from a world that he's lost the ability to see the good in. His attention soon turns outside to Optimus, who's obliging a young patient's interest in his ability to transform. Sparky then talks with Optimus about the Matrix: it was a gift Optimus had received many years ago, and he had used every last bit of its energy to re-power the hospital, leaving Spike's fate in the hands of the Great Spark. Sparky is confused at the idea of Optimus having a "god", since Optimus seems to fit the bill himself, a notion that amuses Optimus — Sparky is underestimating his own might.

In the generator room, Optimus reunites with Jazz and Ratchet, who's finished fixing the hospital's generators. Ratchet berates his leader for his dangerous use of the Matrix, suggesting that he should've instead used it to fix himself — an idea Optimus finds abhorrent, given that the alternative would be letting the innocent humans die. Ratchet fires back that the humans aren't innocent; they're prone to anger and destruction... which, as Optimus muses, makes them just like Cybertronians. Just then, Jazz collapses — Ratchet had used up all the energon from the rest of their Autobot comrades' bodies to bring Jazz back online, but it was only just enough. Ratchet tells Optimus that they need to start thinking about themselves, as without a way to get more energon, the Autobots may as well be on death's door. However, Ratchet has something stashed in Optimus' trailer that might help the Autobots regain the initiative... which Optimus finds too disgusting to consider using. As Ratchet claims that they don't have much of a choice, Sparky interrupts them: he might have an idea regarding their energy problem...

Meanwhile, in a wrecked hospital room, Cliffjumper attempts to comfort the grief-stricken Carly, as he can relate to how she's feeling: long before the Autobots and Decepticons arrived on Earth, Starscream killed his entire clan (i.e. "family"), and he joined the war the very next day. Optimus then approaches, now equipped with a new arm that has a large cannon mounted on the side, and asks Cliff if he's interested in going on the offensive. At the Ark , Starscream's work of salvaging the still-living Skywarp for materials continues, as he triumphantly proclaims that he will forever be Decepticon leader... while in an Arctic region, an offline Megatron , badly damaged and conspicuously missing his right arm, remains partially embedded in ice.

# Transformers (2023) issue 5

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_5 -->

## Synopsis

Optimus Prime and Sparky each reflect and share their experiences in their respective wars. Sparky asks Optimus, who has seen so much more than he ever will, why it has to be like this, but Prime solemnly laments that even he isn't sure. Staring at his reflection, with Megatron 's arm replacing his missing one, Prime wonders aloud if he's becoming the very thing he fights against.

In the Ark , the Decepticons use Teletraan I , now rebuilt using parts from Skywarp 's body, to rebuild their fellow soldiers. Upon revival, Thundercracker is horrified to see what's become of Skywarp, but Starscream reassures him that Skywarp sacrificed himself for the greater good of the Decepticons. Laserbeak alerts Soundwave that the Autobots have discovered their source of energy, so Starscream decides to lead Soundwave, Thundercracker, and the newly-revived Frenzy and Reflector to attack.

At the local dam, Sparky helps Ratchet and a newly revived Wheeljack (currently using only half his body due to their limited resources) to turn the water from the dam to power an energon -generating turbine. Wheeljack offers to repair Optimus, but Optimus insists on using their energy supply to help restore their fellow warriors, reviving Arcee next. Arcee is happy to be back, but the Decepticons' attack interrupts the joyous occasion. Reflector tries to attack Optimus, but is swiftly obliterated by his fusion cannon . Frenzy fares no better after Prime smashes his skull open on the ground. Starscream rails at Prime for taking something "precious" to the Decepticons, but Optimus balks at this, taunting that Starscream fears the cannon as he feared its previous wielder. An enraged Starscream turns his null-rays on the water turbine and destroys it, but is ultimately forced to retreat when Prime blasts him with the fusion cannon.

With their number bolstered and the Decepticons retreating, Prime decides now to retake the Ark . Sparky decides to join them and Carly asks to go as well, but both Optimus and Sparky refuse, not wanting her to get hurt like Spike . Optimus orders the Autobots to roll out, but Cliffjumper decides to sneak Carly into his driver's seat, feeling she deserves to be there when they finally stop the Decepticons for good. Night falls as the Autobots arrive at the Ark , but as they approach the ship, they are beset by a convoy of green construction vehicles. A repaired Starscream appears and gloats that he knew the Autobots would follow them back to the ship. He then orders the Constructicons to do what they do best: merge and form Devastator !

# Transformers (2023) issue 6

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_6 -->

## Synopsis

The Autobots and Sparky Witwicky attempt to take cover inside the Ark as Devastator attacks. Having fallen behind, Cliffjumper attempts to assist, but Carly advises him instead to look for an alternate way into the Ark so that they can find more firepower. Starscream cackles in delight at the destruction wrought by the Decepticon combiner , only to be summarily kicked in the face by Optimus Prime . Devastator grabs Prime and tosses him around, severely injuring the Autobot leader. Arcee drags him into the Ark while Jazz lays down suppressive fire. Devastator then grabs Ratchet and attempts to drag him out, forcing the Autobots to close the Ark’s bay doors and cutting off Ratchet’s leg in the process. Devastator tries to punch through the door, but Soundwave orders him to stop as to not damage their sanctuary, instead suggesting getting into the Ark by digging through the mountain; Devastator complies. Cliffjumper and Carly scale the side of the mountain and reach the access port on the back of the ship, however they are soon confronted by Starscream.

The other Autobots get Optimus onto a table, but Ratchet tells them that his wounds are too severe for him to fix. As he starts to succumb to his injuries, Optimus apologizes to his friends for leading them on false hope. He takes the Matrix of Leadership from his chest and attempts to give it to one of them, but is so weakened he drops it on the floor. Sparky approaches it, contemplating that every-time something bad has happened to the people he cares about, he’s always wondered if he could have somehow taken their place. He places his hand inside the Matrix and asks Optimus to tell Spike Witwicky how proud he is of him before entering the Matrix completely, renewing its energy and repairing Prime in the process. Revitalized, Prime says Sparky will not be forgotten and promises to protect Spike and the whole world. At that moment, Devastator breaks through the ceiling of the ship, but a resolute Prime simply grabs him by the finger and rips it off! He then grabs his ion blaster and uses it in tandem with Megatron ’s fusion cannon to unleash hell on the giant gestalt.

Meanwhile, Starscream has Cliffjumper pinned down and gloats about how he massacred the Autobot's clan. As the two grapple, Carly aims one of the Transformers' guns at Starscream and fires. Cliffjumper then takes the gun and aims it directly at Starscream's head. He tells the Seeker that he's always wondered what this moment would feel like, ready to pull the trigger... but he can't do it. Carly angrily reminds Cliff of everything Starscream has done, but Cliff is simply too tired of all the fighting and death. However, his hesitation gives Starscream the chance to recover and he grabs Carly and begins to squeeze. Outside, Optimus leads Devastator to the edge of a cliff, goading him to follow him. As Devastator attempts to rush Optimus, Prime maneuvers under the giant and pushes him over the edge, where he falls right on top of Starscream and frees Carly from the Decepticon's grip. With their leader damaged, the Decepticons decide to retreat, the Constructicons hauling Starscream away. Optimus attempts to make peace with Soundwave so that the two sides can work together to save their home , but Soundwave rejects the parlay and flies off with Thundercracker.

Back at the Farmingham Hospital, Spike wakes up. The Doctor tells him not to speak, so on a nearby piece of paper Spike writes just one thing: "Where's my dad?"

# Transformers (2023) issue 7

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_7 -->

## Synopsis

On Cybertron , a squad of Autobots led by Elita One are ambushed by Decepticons while attempting to storm a fortress belonging to Shockwave looking for one of their own. One by one, Huffer , Warpath , and Kup are taken down, with the latter urging Elita to keep going and save “him”. Kicking in the door to the fortress, Elita is horrified to find who they were looking for: Ultra Magnus , stripped to a near-skeletal pile of parts.

Back on Earth , in the Pacific Ocean , the captain of the U.S.S. Henry Harrison gets a call from an Admiral ordering him to head to the coast of Washington in search of “ giant robots .”

Meanwhile, Soundwave calls a meeting amongst the Decepticons to challenge Starscream for command. Starscream tries to turn the others against Soundwave, but Thundercracker reminds Starscream that this is their way, and to prepare himself for combat. Soundwave begins to beat on Starscream without hesitation. Though the Seeker tries to bargain with Soundwave, he refuses to yield, and the battle culminates in Starscream losing an eye to Laserbeak before Soundwave rips several pieces from Starscream's chest and sends him over the edge of a cliff. Soundwave promises the other Decepticons that he will not just act in his interests, but that they will rebuild, conquer, and destroy together. The rest of the Decepticons kneel before him, pledging their loyalty to their new leader.

Outside the Ark , Arcee introduces herself to Carly , who's practicing with a rifle. Arcee asks if she can join her and blasts away Carly's makeshift can and bottle targets, impressing the human girl. Arcee laments her own talent for killing and tells Carly that she reminds Arcee of herself: her clan was killed when she was young, but she was rescued by Ultra Magnus, who taught her how to fight. But as the war progressed, Arcee learned how the path of hate takes more than it heals, claiming Ultra Magnus died because of her. Carly, incredulous at this lecture, returns to shooting her rifle. Inside the ship, the pair are watched by Jazz and Cliffjumper . Cliff tells Jazz that Carly hasn't spoken to him since he refused to pull the trigger on Starscream, but Jazz assures him he did the right thing.

Optimus Prime and Ratchet go to visit Spike Witwicky at the Farmingham Hospital, but Spike doesn't wish to speak to him, saying that he needs more time after his father sacrificed himself. As the two drive back to the Ark , Optimus has a vision of himself holding a baby human. He is so distracted by this vision that he ends up driving off the road. Ratchet asks what happened, and Prime simply responds that he doesn't know. The pair eventually return to the Ark , where Wheeljack informs the Autobots that repairing more of their forces has been difficult with the Skywarp -augmented Teletraan 1 locking him out of the repair systems and that it will take him time to figure out a workaround. Optimus asks him to make haste; the Autobots have the upper hand but they need to take the fight to the Decepticons. Wheeljack says they'll need a way to find them, idly musing about creating some sort of flying vehicle. Optimus says he has a plan for that, looking at the remains of Jetfire .

Carly brings Spike Witwicky to a lake outside Farmingham , thinking it will help his recovery to get some fresh air. When she asks how he feels, Spike tells her he doesn't feel anything . Carly says that with the world changing, they have to protect themselves. Cliffjumper joins them, even offering them colas, but Carly is still angry at him for not killing Starscream , feeling like she can't trust him anymore. She storms off, leaving Spike to comfort a dejected Cliff.

On Cybertron , Elita One carries the mangled body of a delirious Ultra Magnus through the fortress, looking for an exit. Having experienced over a hundred fifty years of torture, Magnus begs Elita to kill him. Elita apologizes for taking so long to find him and assures him that she won't let him go again, but ultimately promises to follow Magnus's order—for both of them—if they are captured.

In the Pacific Ocean , U.S.S. Henry Harrison makes its way towards Washington when Soundwave and Thundercracker attack. Thundercracker pities the humans, and when the Captain begs for his life, he begins to let them go. Soundwave points out that while they pose no threat to them, they will likely inform their superiors about their attack, and thus they cannot be allowed to go free. He blasts the humans fleeing on lifeboats.

On the Ark , Wheeljack is still trying to use Teletraan One despite the interference of Skywarp , whose fusion with the computer gives him more control over it and whom Wheeljack can't remove without compromising what remains of Teletraan. Optimus pities the Seeker for what his fellow Decepticons did to him, especially after seeing a video log of him getting ripped apart. However, Carly enters carrying a missile launcher, planning to kill what remains of Skywarp. Optimus tries to talk her down, but her finger slips on the trigger, sending the missile headed towards the computer. However, Arcee takes the shot, saving Teletraan and Skywarp, much to Carly's distress. Grateful to be saved, Skywarp uses Teletraan to fix Wheeljack's legs. Optimus tries to use this as a teaching moment for Carly, but she's not having any of it and storms off to her van. Arcee follows after her, and Carly apologizes. Carly admits that she’s confused why the Autobots don't act like the giant badass robots she sees, but Arcee reveals that before Optimus brought them together, they were all scattered and lost. She tells Carly that while Optimus tries to hide it, his losses are greater than anyone's.

Later, Optimus awakens from a dream where he sees himself with a human child as the boy grows through the years. He questions what these visions mean, but is soon distracted by the newly-awoken Jetfire , whom Ratchet was able to save from death, but unfortunately, he is now mode locked and blind, much to Jetfire's horror. Optimus apologizes, trying to justify it as an allocation of resources, but when he turns to leave, Jetfire begs him to stay, not wanting to be left alone in the darkness. Optimus agrees to sit with him awhile.

Having sunk the Henry Harrison , Soundwave and Thundercracker follow it down to the sea floor, where the Constructicons have been unearthing the key to Soundwave's ultimate plan: the Nemesis , the ship which brought the Decepticons to Earth all those years ago! As the Decepticons work to repair the ship, they hear a loud banging coming from inside the ship's brig. Soundwave orders the Decepticons open it, much to their trepidation, saying they need all the help they can get. As the doors open, an enraged Astrotrain tears through them, demanding to know where Megatron is. As he tears through the smaller Decepticon warriors, Soundwave tries to get him to calm down, saying that they don't know where Megatron is now, but promising to give him to Astrotrain when they find him.

Back at the Ark , Wheeljack detects the activation of the Nemesis . Optimus orders the Autobots to board Jetfire so that they might finally take the fight to their enemy. Carly insists on coming, but Optimus refuses, telling her she isn't a warrior. Arcee offers to take Carly on as her iron apprentice —a sacred bond between (typically) an older and younger Cybertronian that marks the beginning of a clan , and the same relationship Ultra Magnus had with Arcee many years ago. Optimus reluctantly agrees, but orders them to instead stay at the Ark with Wheeljack to defend their home and watch over Spike as the rest of the Autobots depart in Jetfire.

On the Nemesis , Thundercracker asks when the ship will take to the skies, but Soundwave reports that that will require too much energon . What they really need is the ship's antennae, which will allow them to finally call for reinforcements. Soundwave activates the monitor on the ship's bridge, and the image of Shockwave appears.

# Transformers (2023) issue 9

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_9 -->

## Synopsis

As the Autobots near the Decepticons ' location in the Pacific Ocean , Soundwave activates a device from the bridge of the Nemesis . From an antenna atop the ship, a whirlpool begins to form and a beam of pink energy fires into the sky which grazes Jetfire , sending the Autobot jet careening to the bottom of the ocean floor. As the Autobots are thrown from their companion, they are confronted by the Constructicons as they work on the device — a space bridge , through which Shockwave steps through! The Autobots scramble to fight back as the Decepticons converge on them. Cliffjumper is cornered by Soundwave, wielding Shockwave in his gun mode, but is saved from execution by Ratchet taking the blast for him and allowing Optimus Prime to intervene. Shockwave quickly engages the Autobot leader, eager to pay him back after their last encounter.

In Farmingham , Wheeljack , Arcee , and Carly make their way back to the dam, hoping to repair their energon turbine with supplies from the Ark . Carly is eager to learn how to fight, but Arcee informs her that being linked is more about looking out for each other than it is fighting. However, a mile out from the dam, they are confronted by the Farmingham milita . Carly rushes out in front of the militia and urges them to stand down, telling them the Autobots are the good guys. Meanwhile, at Farmingham Hosptial , Spike Witwicky learns from the doctor that his spine was grazed by the bullet when the militia accidentally shot him. Spike asks if he'll ever walk again, but the doctor's words of reassurance are interrupted by the sound of Astrotrain , who has come looking for Spike. Though he doesn't wish to to harm any "lesser beings", he threatens to destroy the hospital if Spike doesn't come with him; Spike agrees without hesitation.

On Cybertron , Elita One and Ultra Magnus are cornered by the Combaticons . Unable to find an escape, Elita follows a pink glow at the end of a corridor, discovering the portal Shockwave used to come to Earth, arriving on the alien world in the midst of Optimus and Shockwave's battle. The Combaticons begin to follow them through, with Onslaught giving the order to merge. Without missing a beat, Elita grabs Prime's ion blaster and fires at the space bridge. Onslaught leaps through, but Brawl is caught in between the portal and is bisected as it closes. Soundwave orders the Decepticons to eliminate the rest of the Autobots and they open fire on Cliffjumper and Jazz . Elita insists that she and Optimus retreat, dragging both him and Magnus away from the combat. Soundwave prepares to go after them, but Shockwave tells him to focus on repairing the space bridge. The cyclopean Decepticon then discovers the abandoned Cliffjumper and Jazz, eager to have new subjects to "experiment" with.

As Astrotrain approaches the Pacific, he tells Spike about how Cybertron has been plagued with disease, but that the resources of Earth will help the Decepticons save their world, even at the cost to the humans. Spike protests, but Astrotrain nonchalantly says that it is simply the way for "a weaker species." Astrotrain also reveals that he will be delivered to Shockwave as an offering from Soundwave to experiment with the native lifeform. As they approach the coastline, a blue-and-white machine attaches to the Decepticon, shutting off his engines and sending him crashing to the shore. The side of Astrotrain is torn open by Beachcomber , who's here to rescue Spike!

# Transformers (2023) issue 10

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_10 -->

## Synopsis

Millions of years ago, the Decepticons attack the Ark as it reaches Earth orbit. During the battle, Beachcomber is thrown out of the ship by Skywarp and lands on the moon . As he looks up, he sees the Earth; overwhelmed with its beauty, he spends the next million years staring at it until July 20 , 1969 , when the Apollo 11 moon mission arrives. Hitching a ride on their return flight, he makes his way to Earth, finding the planet’s surface just as wondrous as he imagined. While exploring, he finds the Ark and its off-line passengers. Though he begins to activate Teletraan-1 's repair function, he hesitates. Fearing the devastation that could come if the Transformers ' war began again on Earth, he abandons them, allowing them the peace of sleeping forever.

Beachcomber tells his tale to Spike Witwicky , having rescued him from Astrotrain , who Beachcomber has chained up to prevent him from attacking. However, he still offers the Triple Changer some of the energon he took from the Ark ' s reserves as a peace offering. Astrotrain reveals to Beachcomber that Shockwave has come to Earth with the intent of harvesting its resources. Though Beachcomber knows the destruction Shockwave will bring, he also vowed never to hurt anyone or anything again and wants no part in the war.

Back at the dam, Wheeljack puts the finishing touches on his Energon turbine when Optimus Prime returns with Elita One and Ultra Magnus in tow. Arcee is shocked to see her old mentor , believing him dead. Wheeljack reassures Magnus that Ratchet will fix him right up, leading Optimus to reveal that Ratchet didn't survive the battle. Wheeljack excuses himself to grieve. Optimus regrets also leaving Cliffjumper and Jazz behind, with Elita telling him that Shockwave will likely do to them what he did to Magnus. She then chastises him for leaving Cybertron and letting it fall to the Decepticons; Shockwave stripped their home for everything it had, and now he’ll do the same to Prime’s new paradise.

In the depths of the Nemesis , Jazz and Cliff are in chains as Shockwave arrives, eager to begin "experimenting" on them. Thundercracker , who finds Shockwave's actions dishonorable, is led outside by Soundwave to discuss their next steps, and though they may not like it, they need Shockwave. Thundercracker then argues they should mount an assault on the Ark to rescue Skywarp, but Soundwave shoots it down. Shockwave then gathers the Decepticons. He announces that time is of the essence if they want to save their world and, using the Energon converted by the feeder, reactivates the space bridge , though now on a much larger scale in order to bring Cybertron into Earth's orbit. Beachcomber and Spike look on in horror as the Transformers' home fills the sky.

# Transformers (2023) issue 11

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_11 -->

## Synopsis

Using a high-tech surfboard, Beachcomber investigates the whirlpool created by Shockwave 's attempt to bring Cybertron into Earth orbit.

Meanwhile, on the Ark , Arcee speaks to an unconcious Ultra Magnus , guilt-ridden for leaving him to be tortured by Shockwave. Elita One chastises Arcee for leaving as well, causing Arcee to deck her in anger. Witnessing this exchange, Carly asks what happened to him, leading Arcee to reveal that this is what happens to bots captured by Shockwave, meaning that Cliffjumper and Jazz are likely being tortured as they speak. The idea horrifies Carly. Optimus Prime confers with Wheeljack about Magnus’s repairs, but Wheeljack is unable to fully repair Ultra Magnus without Ratchet , and doing so would use up their remaining Energon . Wheeljack suggests that they could keep him in his current state and revive more Autobots instead, but Magnus awakens and pleads with Optimus that he wants to fight as part of this new resistance.

Aboard the Nemesis , Soundwave asks Shockwave to take Ravage back to Cybertron to be repaired, but Shockwave insists that there are more important matters to be attended to. He then returns to Cybertron himself and orders the Combaticons to ready their defenses against any potential attacks from the remaining Autobot rebels. When the Combaticons inquire about the status of Brawl and Onslaught , Shockwave brushes aside their concerns as well.

The Autobots quickly deduce that the space bridge bringing Cybertron is connected between the Nemesis and Shockwave' fortress , using that to siphon the energy collected from Earth into Energon stores in the fortress. If they can destroy the Nemesis , they can cut that connection off, but it's likely Shockwave already has enough Energon stored up to crush the remaining Autobots on Cybertron. Carly insists that their first priority should be rescuing Cliffjumper, to which Optimus agrees. However, Elita balks at this. She chastises Prime for leaving her and the rest of the Autobots alone on Cybertron for centuries and letting Shockwave's forces slowly destroy them. She does not want to risk losing their home to the Decepticons to save this new world. Optimus merely says that he is confident in their abilities and old friends. Arcee, enraged by what the Decepticons did to Magnus, prepares for battle while Carly—surprised at the turn her Iron Intercessor has taken—looks on. Elita One tells her that she is proud to see her fire returning.

The Autobots formulate a plan: using Skywarp 's teleportation abilities, now connected to Teletraan I , they will teleport inside the Nemesis and use a series of explosives to destroy the Decepticon flagship, severing its space bridge connection. Carly insists on coming along, believing rescuing Cliffjumper to be her responsibility, but both Optimus and Arcee refuse, promising to bring him home for her.

Beachcomber returns to where he left Spike and Astrotrain and tells Spike of what he saw. Spike asks if they should do something, but Beachcomber solemnly states that there's nothing they can do. He leaves a canister of Energon for Astrotrain before taking Spike to find another quiet part of the world to wait for the inevitable end. As they walk through the woods, Spike sees a deer and recalls when Optimus first stepped foot on the planet. Spike tells Beachcomber that while he knows the fighting is wrong, that doesn't mean they can just run away.

Aboard the Nemesis , Shockwave continues to torture Jazz and Cliffjumper, but is interrupted by the arrival of Optimus Prime and the other Autobots. As Optimus frees their comrades and Elita finishes planting the charges, Arcee threatens to execute Shockwave, but Prime stops her, fearing what might happen if she gives into her anger. Unfortunately, her hesitation gives Shockwave an opening to attack, taking Cliffjumper hostage and escaping. The Decepticon leader orders the Constructicons to form Devastator , but Optimus isn't worried: teleporting in behind them are Wheeljack and the now fully restored Ultra Magnus!

However, upon seeing Shockwave again, Magnus freezes. He can't do it. In a fit of panic, he drops his weapon and retreats, apologizing all the while. As their strongest warrior drives off, Shockwave gloats. He broke the mind of the mighty Ultra Magnus, and now he’ll break the rest of the Autobots' bodies!

# Transformers (2023) issue 12

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_12 -->

## Synopsis

On the Ark , Carly watches as the Decepticons surround the Autobots . Realizing she needs to help them, she gets in her van and drives through the Skywarp generated portal, ramming a Shockwave -wielding Soundwave and saving Cliffjumper . Carly apologizes for not being there when Cliff needed her, but their heartwarming reunion is cut short by Devastator smashing her van. Cliffjumper manages to rescue Carly, but his arm and the van's wreckage are crushed together by Devastator's foot. Before anything can be done to free him, he and the van are flung by Devastator through the portal to Cybertron , crashing into the Combaticons . Optimus Prime uses this opportunity to rally the rest of the Autobots against Devastator, blasting him until he falls and crushes Shockwave's energon harvester. This disconnects the space bridge and Wheeljack reports to Optimus that Cybertron is returning to its original place. While the portal is still active, Shockwave retreats to summon reinforcements, but Optimus chases after him to stop the Decepticon leader and rescue Cliffjumper.

Bursting through the portal, he swiftly and savagely attacks the Combaticons, forcing them to retreat, much to the irritation of Shockwave. Shockwave threatens Cliffjumper as Optimus approaches, but Prime simply blasts his arm off with his ion blaster . Dropping his weapon as he continues toward the Decepticon, he decries Shockwave's irreverence for life, savagely beating him into the ground and grabbing his cyclopean head. As he does, he once again sees a vision of himself holding the small human baby... before the vision changes to a nightmarish version, his hands as claws and the baby surrounded by wire. The vision overtakes Prime, his optics flushing pink, and he crushes Shockwave's head with his bare hands. As he regains his senses (and his blue eyes), he is horrified at what he's done, but Elita One is happy to see that he's regained his ruthlessness.

With Cybertron returning to its proper place in the galaxy, Optimus picks up Cliffjumper and prepares to head back to Earth, but they are halted by Elita blowing up the portal. She tells Optimus that the Autobots need him here on Cybertron, and that with the Energon Shockwave collected with the harvester, they can use it to strike back against the Decepticons and revive their planet. Optimus refuses to use Energon taken from the life and resources on Earth and activates the charges to destroy the harvester, but nothing happens. Elita reveals she never set the charges; Earth has so much to give to Cybertron. This could save their world! But Optimus can't allow that. He won't save his world with the blood of another. He aims his fusion cannon at the Energon. Elita pleads with him, saying that they need him. He apologizes to her and fires.

The Energon explodes, creating a blast that severs the connection between the Energon harvesters, closing the portal and blasting off a huge chunk of Cybertron, which begins falling into the Earth's atmosphere… along with Optimus Prime. As he begins to burn upon reentry, he wonders if he's about to die and marvels at Earth's beauty. His sentiment is shared by Beachcomber , rocketing up to Prime on his rocket surfboard. He grabs the Autobot leader's hand and the pair shred down to the surface. Optimus looks in horror at what he's done as the piece of Cybertron falls into the ocean.

# Transformers (2023) issue 13

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_13 -->

## Synopsis

At a meeting of the Decepticons , Soundwave rips out Starscream 's guts and sends him tumbling over a nearby cliff. Beaten, weary, and delirious, Starscream lands on the ground below, narrowly avoiding a nearby pool of lava, and memories of his past start bubbling up...

On the dying world of Cybertron , a bot named Ulchtar is doing some work when his friend Genvo urges him to come see something that happens only once every two hundred years. Though initially insistent on completing his job, Ulchtar relents when his other friend Jetfire insists that they make his last night on Cybertron one to remember. The trio head to Moonbase Two to get the best view, and begin discussing the fighting that's been happening on the planet of late: though his brothers have refused to join a side, Ulchtar himself hasn't heard much of anything; Genvo insists that Ulchtar join his side , citing their one-of-a-kind leader and the fact that him and Ulchtar would make an incredible team; and Jetfire states that his path is already decided — using maps laid out by Ulchtar, he'll be traveling the stars in search of a conflict-free solution to their planet's issues. Genvo starts questioning if there even is anything to find out there before he notices some Turbosects and begins squashing them before Ulchtar, who considers them to be beautiful, harmless creatures, intervenes. Just then, the moment they were waiting for arrives: a titanic robot flies overhead, and Ulchtar suddenly gets an idea. Wanting the large robot to see them, he breaks into an ammunition depot for the Cybertronian Defense Force and uses one of their grenades to hopefully create enough commotion for the robot to take notice. Ulchtar succeeds, and the giant robot reciprocates the group's wave of "hello" before the depot's cranky old guard chases them off. Soon after, Jetfire wishes his friends farewell, and flies off to begin his mission. Ulchtar is sad to see him go, but he thankfully still has Genvo around...

Some time later, Ulchtar heads outside to find a battle involving Genvo's faction has erupted, and a stray missile destroys his lab. Before Ulchtar can get any answers, Genvo grabs his friend and runs... but gets shot for his trouble. Genvo praises Ulchtar for "screaming the stars into seeing us", and dies in his friend's arms. While in grief over the loss of his friend, Ulchtar looks up to see the apparent culprits: a red-and-blue robot and his followers ...

The shock of this memory awakens Starscream from his trance long enough for him to pull himself away from the lava, his legs having been melted in his stupor, before he falls unconscious. Seizing the opportunity, a group of humans that had been observing Starscream begin hoisting his body onto their tank . Horton , the group's commanding officer remarks to Private Martin that his father was a genuine American hero, with Private Razz chiming in that that was before being recruited by M.A.R.S. Unfortunately, Private Clayton loses hold of Starscream's body, setting the commanding officer off: despite how celebrated and worshipped his father was in both life and death, he's been given command of this lowly, good-for-nothing salvage unit for his troubles... but with the power of Starscream now at his disposal, that's about to change.

With his work destroyed and his only planet-side friend dead, Ulchtar ponders his future. Just then, a silver robot bearing the insignia of Genvo's faction approaches him, offering revenge for his friend and clan as a Decepticon warrior. The robot transforms into a tank-like pistol small enough for Ulchtar to hold, and asks what his brothers called him. Inspired by his friend's dying words, he gives his answer: his name is Starscream.

## Synopsis

Having recovered the body of Starscream , M.A.R.S. commander Horton and his team have decided to affix the Decepticon warrior to their H.I.S.S. tank , complete with a remote control for the vehicle. However, after completing their project, Starscream awakens, horrified at what they've done to him. He tries to kill the humans (along with Private Razz 's cat ), but is weak without energon and unable to control his movements. Horton offers to help Starscream, which the angry Seeker rebuffs. However, Horton reveals that they took the precaution of installing explosives in Starscream's body while he was out, forcing Starscream to capitulate to him. Starscream goes along with Horton, sensing that they both have the same desire for power.

Years ago, on Cybertron , Megatron and Starscream attack a group of Autobots . Taking them prisoner, Megatron offers them the chance to join the Decepticons. When they refuse, Megatron transforms into his gun mode and orders Starscream to use him to execute their enemies. Starscream is hesitant, not wanting to murder prisoners of war. However, Megatron compels him and Starscream follows through, apologizing all the while. Over the course of the war, the pair kill more and more Autobots, Megatron turning Starscream into his "hand of death."

As Starscream and the M.A.R.S. troops travel, they come across the chained-up Astrotrain , much to Starscream's surprise. Astrotrain reveals that Soundwave released him from the Nemesis , offering him revenge on Megatron to join his plan. Starscream balks at the idea that Soundwave would willingly give up his master, but frees Astrotrain and assures him that if the Triple Changer joins him, he will deliver on Soundwave’s false promise. Horton is about to object, but the conversation is interrupted by a piece of Cybertron falling from the sky into the Pacific Ocean . As the piece's impact causes a tidal wave, the humans begin to flee while Astrotrain transforms to transport Starscream away. However, Horton uses the controller to prevent Starscream from boarding his ally. Starscream demands Horton get him onto Astrotrain, offering to get the M.A.R.S. team to safety as well.

Aboard Astrotrain's shuttle mode, Horton reminds Starscream that he's in charge of their arrangement. Astrotrain then alerts Starscream to the sight of Onslaught and Brawl in the water. The Decepticons rescue their allies, much to the irritation of Horton as he loses more and more control over the situation. Horton orders his team to be taken down to the surface, but at that moment, Astrotrain hits a rogue wave, sending the humans tumbling and knocking Horton unconscious.

When he awakes, Horton finds himself on the chunk of Cybertron, with Starscream being hailed as leader by Astrotrain and the reassembled roster of the Combaticons . Starscream tells his assembly that their first order of business will be to take the fight to Soundwave and his Decepticons, but they are interrupted by Horton, who has realized Starscream has double-crossed him. The M.A.R.S. commander threatens Starscream with the explosives his team placed in him, but when he presses the button, nothing happens. Razz and the rest of the team emerge and reveal Starscream promised to free them if they removed the explosives. Starscream thanks Razz for her help... then squashes her with his hand before turning his null-rays on Clayton and squishing Horton under his tank treads, leaving only Razz's cat and Martin alive. He orders Martin to begin sketching, wanting the artist to document his rise to power.

## Synopsis

With the Decepticons once again on the back foot, Soundwave leads his men in razing the city of Tacoma , Washington . Though Thundercracker voices his displeasure and suggests returning to the chunk of Cybertron that fell into the ocean, Soundwave insists that their battle is here, where resources are far more plentiful and the Autobots ' precious humans are ripe for the slaughter. He plans on taking his troops city-by-city, creating a path of mayhem and destruction that can draw their enemy out for an ambush. Spotting a group of humans hiding in a damaged building, Thundercracker quietly whispers for them to run before taking the building down.

Cliffjumper reawakens on Cybertron, having been thrown away from Optimus by the detonation of Shockwave 's energy reserves. Cliff's found by three of his fellow Autobots: Bluestreak , a heavily-damaged Warpath , and a panicked Blurr , who informs them of incoming Decepticons. As the group leaves, Warpath asks about the others , only for Bluestreak to sadly inform him that they're gone...

At the Ark , Arcee and Optimus discuss the battle at the Nemesis . Arcee feels guilty over letting her anger almost get the better of her, and plans to track down her old mentor Ultra Magnus to make amends and help him the same way he helped her. Joining her are Carly , Spike , and Beachcomber , who politely refuses Optimus' offer to join him in the fight due to his oath of non-violence, but tells him to do what he has to before the group departs. As Optimus sees them off, Wheeljack informs him of radio chatter regarding the Decepticons' attack, and they, along with Jazz , head off to investigate. En route, Wheeljack informs Optimus that he'd done scans of his mind, but was unable to find anything regarding his mysterious visions. Optimus theorizes that they might be coming from the Matrix , which should be empty, since Optimus used all of its energy on self-repairs after Sparky 's sacrifice, but since it's never interfaced with an organic being before, Wheeljack thinks that the merging of the mechanical and the organic might be causing errors in his neural net. Before they can theorize further, however, the Autobots arrive at the burning wreckage of Tacoma and begin rescue operations. However, the surviving humans and the newly-arrived military forces don't take kindly to their presence, and after another disturbing vision, this time of a human child in claws being infested by wiring, Optimus is overcome with rage at the humans for causing things harm and attacks their tank. Jazz quickly snaps him out of it before serious harm can be done, and the Autobots leave before more of the military arrive.

Watching these events unfold from a distance are Soundwave, Laserbeak , and Scrapper , who insists they push the attack now. Soundwave tells him to be patient— with the Autobots so few in number, the Decepticons will simply follow them to wherever they regroup at and ambush them there. After lamenting that Ravage 's repairs will once again have to be held off, Soundwave sends Laserbeak off on a mission of great import— something he should've done as soon as he had been woken up, and a task that Laserbeak must finish before he returns to his master...

Back on Cybertron, Bluestreak and co. find Ramjet in their path. After Blurr confirms that there's no way around him, Bluestreak pulls out a knife and rushes the Conehead , stabbing him through the back. Bluestreak, Blurr, and Warpath rush to gather up as much of Ramjet's energon as they can, which disturbs Cliffjumper. Bluestreak remarks that being with Optimus has softened Cliff's edges, but as Cliff retorts that Optimus has taught him a better way, Elita One arrives, asking Cliff when the last time his leader had to truly survive was.

Optimus' team arrive at the dam, Wheeljack asking Optimus what had happened. Optimus remarks that he doesn't know, but he's feeling like his younger, more angry and vengeful self; Wheeljack says he'll do more scans when they return to the Ark , but first they need reinforcements to make up for Arcee and Beachcomber's absence. However, before they can bring Trailbreaker back online, Optimus and co. are attacked by Astrotrain , who lands and unloads his cargo: Starscream and the Combaticons . Starscream rolls up to Optimus... and then passes him by to talk to his true targets, as Soundwave's Decepticons have also arrived. Onslaught then orders his team to merge, and Bruticus rises up!

## Synopsis

Despite her reservations, Elita One leads Cliffjumper and Bluestreak across the war-torn wastes of Cybertron to what was once the home of Cliffjumper's clan , long forgotten by the Decepticons ever since they destroyed it in a bombing campaign. Cliffjumper digs through the rubble to find a spark canister he had hidden away; though there isn't enough remaining to bring back any of his friends, he says there's the possibility it can be used to create something new.

On Earth , Soundwave orders the Constructicons to merge into Devastator to combat Bruticus . As Starscream , Soundwave, and their respective troops clash, Optimus Prime , Jazz , and Wheeljack are caught in the middle of the carnage. Thundercracker tries to reason with Starscream, but the one-time Decepticon leader is too obsessed with revenge and reveals the truth of what he and Soundwave did to Skywarp . As Starscream rants about the universe being made only for the strong, Thundercracker uses the H.I.S.S. tank remote control to steer Starscream's body off a ledge. The blue Seeker then transforms and flies away, abandoning Soundwave to the fury of Astrotrain . Optimus decides the Autobots must intervene, fearing that the Decepticons’ senseless violence could damage the dam and endanger the humans. However, he is again overcome with visions and rage, firing his fusion cannon straight at the dam. Water bursts through the structure and sweeps away all the Transformers . As the water rushes through the woods, Optimus spots two children on bikes fleeing from the waves. He tries to save them but is unable to reach them. Luckily, they are saved by the timely arrival of Trailbreaker , who uses his force field to protect the “strange little creatures,” who managed to survive nearly being crushed by the combiners.

Back on Cybertron, the Autobots return to their makeshift headquarters and Elita explains to Cliffjumper that they’ve been unable to communicate with any other Autobot resistances and that they could be the only ones left. Elita asks Cliff what he plans to do with the sparks in the canister, and he reveals his plan to take them to the Well of Sparks . Elita reveals that the Well is deep in Decepticon-controlled territory, but Cliff insists that they need a new warrior to help them, something Bluestreak echoes. And afterward, Cliff will return to Earth. To Carly .

Meanwhile, Carly and Spike set off on their search for Ultra Magnus with Arcee and Beachcomber . Elsewhere, in some desert, Laserbeak finds that which he was sent to find: Megatron , sitting in a cave, wounded and blinded. Megatron thanks Laserbeak as he grabs the bird, pulls out some of his cables and connects them to his eyes; he orders Laserbeak to act as his eyes and guide him to the Decepticons.

## Synopsis

Thundercracker makes his way to the Ark , where he reunites with Skywarp , still merged with Teletraan One . Thundercracker attempts to separate the two, but Skywarp tells him to stop, as removing him means death. Understanding Skywarp's situation, Thundercracker resolves to find a way to remove his brother from his "prison"...

In the middle of the San Juan Islands , Arcee 's team manages to narrow down Ultra Magnus ' trail, having found his tracks and gotten a stronger lock on his energon readings. Arcee thanks Beachcomber for helping her, and he replies that he's just happy to be useful in a way that doesn't involve violence; when Arcee asks what made him decide to abandon the fight in the first place, Beachcomber recalls the day the Decepticons attacked the Ark — in the midst of the battle, he got a glimpse of the vast wonders of space through a crack in the hull... a sight that made the war seem so meaningless by comparison. As Arcee questions if he really has a choice in the matter, Carly alerts the group to incoming fire, which sends the group tumbling into the water. The blasts are being fired by a rattled Ultra Magnus, who stops when he realizes he's shooting at Arcee — he couldn't recognize his friends through the dark of the woods, and had lost himself in the midst of building a massive fortress to keep himself safe...

On Cybertron , final preparations are underway for Elita One and Cliffjumper 's assault on the Well of Sparks . The weary Elita envies the hope in Cliffjumper's eyes, having been stuck drudging through the never-ending back-and-forth of the war on Cybertron for centuries... which, Cliffjumper remarks, is why Optimus had to leave, intending to find a way forward elsewhere and then return home to save everyone. As Elita begins ranting again about how they're stuck on their own, Bluestreak cuts her short — in the brief moment Optimus returned to Cybertron, he managed to remove Shockwave from the picture, leaving the Decepticons on Cybertron effectively leaderless and giving the Autobots , who've all been suffering as much as she has, an opportunity to turn things around, especially now that they have the means to create reinforcements. Elita agrees, and the team sets off.

As Optimus' team overlook the aftermath of the broken dam, Wheeljack informs Optimus that Bruticus is moving into a large human population by the name of " Seattle ". Despite Wheeljack's objections regarding his mysterious spurts of violence, Optimus rallies his team forward, intent on saving what human lives he can.

At the Hall of Sparks, Thrust is complaining to Ratbat about how he'd rather be battling in Autobot territory than be stuck guarding a place that hasn't seen action in years... right as Blurr whizzes by, and he, Bluestreak, and Warpath blow open a path for Elita and Cliffjumper to make their way inside. Elita incapacitates the two Decepticons and catches up with Cliff at the Well, which mysteriously activates on its own. At the Well's prompting, Cliff inserts his clan's spark canister , and after it confirms the contained sparks are enough to proceed, Cliff prepares to begin the creation event...

In Seattle, the battle between Starscream 's team and Soundwave 's team continues, leaving devastation in its wake. Steeling himself, Optimus orders the Autobots to save as many of the humans as they can. Back at the Well of Sparks, Elita informs Cliff that its program is asking for a secondary mode to model the new Autobot after. On cue, Cliff has Blades deposit Carly's wrecked van, which the Well scans. The new Autobot then emerges, the combination of his clan's sparks causing them to remember Cliff from ages past. When Cliff asks what his new friend calls themselves, they respond: their name is Shredhead !

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_18 -->

## Synopsis

On Cybertron , outside the Well of Sparks , Bluestreak , Warpath , and Blurr are pinned down by a trio of attacking Decepticons : the Seekers Bitstream and Hotlink and the bestial Carnivac . Bluestreak tries to call Elita One , but sadly can't get through to the Autobot commander. However, as Carnivac prepares to chow down on Bluestreak, he is saved by the timely intervention of a black van crashing into the Decepticon wolf. Shredhead transforms and uses their energy sword to quickly dispatch the three Decepticons. The Autobots are then joined by Cliffjumper and Elita, who believes their newest soldier has just turned the tide.

On Earth , Beachcomber , Spike , and Carly camp inside Ultra Magnus ' makeshift fort on the San Juan Islands while Arcee confers with her Iron Intercessor . Like the other Autobots, Magnus is captivated by the beauty of Earth, but admits that he's unable to appreciate it, so clouded by the trauma of his imprisonment at the hands of Shockwave . Arcee tries to assure Magnus that they can still face the future, but the mighty warrior is too despondent. Carly sympathizes with Magnus, as she and Spike also had their lives destroyed by the Decepticons. She thinks that their pain is what brings them together, reassuring Magnus that he’s not alone. However, at that moment, Magnus sees a group of soldiers moving towards the fort. In a panic, he fires on them. Arcee tries to get him to stop, but the group is quickly beset by attack helicopters, triggering flashbacks to Magnus' imprisonment and causing him to attack them. Beachcomber and Spike escape, but a tranquilizer dart knocks out Carly. Arcee grabs her iron apprentice , but an explosion knocks them to the ground. As she recovers, she can only watch as both Carly and Ultra Magnus are carried away by the soldiers.

Meanwhile, in Seattle , the remaining Autobots do what they can to evacuate the humans from the chaos caused by the brawl between Bruticus and Devastator . Unfortunately, they can only do so much as the two combiners tear through the city. Starscream provides the Combaticons air support aboard Astrotrain , but is taken down by Soundwave ejecting Rumble , sending Astrotrain crashing onto the top of a skyscraper. Bruticus goes to rescue his leader with Devastator in pursuit, each giant climbing the tower. As they near the top, Devastator grabs Bruticus in a chokehold, sending them both crashing back to Earth and leveling a city block, much to Optimus Prime 's horror.

Soundwave corners Starscream on the roof, berating him for how low his actions have brought him and readying to execute him. Starscream then gets a second wind and retaliates, ripping open Soundwave's chest compartment and pulling out Ravage ’s still inactive body, mocking Soundwave’s concern for his tapes. However, their fight is interrupted by the return of Megatron , who orders them to stop with a single word. He picks up Ravage and, using his own spark, reactivates him as a reward for Soundwave’s loyalty. As Optimus looks up in horror to see his old nemesis alive, he gives his fellow Autobots a single order: retreat.

## Synopsis

Megatron awakens in a cell on the planet Quintessa . Confused, he demands to know where he is, last remembering being on Moonbase 1 with the rest of his clan . He is then greeted by the Quintesson Prosecutor Dezimir , who tells him that he has been brought to undergo a great trial. Megatron tries to defiantly fight back, but Dezimir uses a device to control and subdue him. He is then brought to an arena, where Dezimir unleashes a horde of Sharkticons on the Cybertronian . However, Megatron is unfazed, and quickly tears through the Sharkticons, even firing a stray shot from his fusion cannon at his captors, only to earn another shock from Dezimir. The Quintesson then activates the next part of the trial: the floor opens underneath Megatron to reveal an inferno. Unfazed, Megatron transforms into his tank mode and blasts at Dezimir's platform. Dezimir taunts Megatron, telling him that while he is powerful, he could be much more. He then summons the mechanical shell of the mighty Mechanokoar and crushes Megatron.

Once more, Megatron awakens in the same cell, confused. Dezimir tells him that failure is not an option, proceeding to drag him out of the cell and back to the Sharkticon pit. Megatron demands to be returned home, but Dezimir tells him to continue fighting. Once again, Megatron defeats the Sharkticons, but is destroyed by the Mechanokoar.

On and on the cycle repeats, hundreds and hundreds of times. Eventually, the strain becomes too much for Megatron, and he breaks down, begging for mercy. Dezimir reveals that this is not only a trial, but a lesson: for as mighty a warrior Megatron may be, compared to the vast universe, he is small —insignificant. Nothing. Just as he is about to finish Megatron with the Mechanokoar once more, a voice from above orders him to stop; his master has declared the trial over. Dezimir reveals that what allowed them to control Megatron was the dark opposite of the Matrix of Leadership , the legendary artifact wielded by the Prime . Through it, Dezimir and his master plan to make Megatron such an opposing force to the Prime. Energy from this dark Matrix surrounds Megatron, granting him a third mode that will allow him to channel its energy to assert his control over others: a gun. The master then orders Dezimir to pick up Megatron, much to the Quintesson's horror. Megatron revels in the power he now has over his captor, forcing him to aim his gun form at the Mechanokoar and destroy the beast.

In the future, Megatron has returned to Cybertron and uses his new power to lead the Decepticons .

## Synopsis

In the ruins of Seattle , now reunited with the Decepticons , Megatron prepares to pursue the fleeing Autobots . However, he is interrupted by a challenge from Astrotrain , as the furious Triple Changer finally confronts the object of his hatred. Megatron welcomes the challenge and, even in his injured state, savagely beats Astrotrain and tosses him off a building, mocking him. Astrotrain begs Megatron to go ahead and kill him, but Megatron assures him he still has plans for him.

Elsewhere, Ultra Magnus has been taken to a secret United States military site to be studied, though progress is slow as they barely know what they're dealing with. Doc talks with a private about having recently seen action while the private mentions that he hasn't heard from his brother, who was serving onboard the USS Henry Harrison . He asks Doc if he'll pray for him, but Doc simply states that he doesn't do that anymore.

At the Ark , Spike convenes with Optimus Prime . Optimus is worried: their forces are spread too thin, and he knows that Megatron will be coming after them as soon as he's reunited the disparate factions of Decepticons. Spike asks Optimus more about the Matrix of Leadership , wondering if his dad might still be in there somewhere, but Prime confirms that he does not hear the voices of any of the Primes who now reside within it. Optimus confesses that he is worried about a darkness inside him that once overtook him at the start of the war, and fears that he won't be able to find the light; however, Spike reassures him that the light always comes back, just like a sunrise.

The pair's bonding moment is then interrupted by the arrival of Beachcomber and the newly-repaired Silverbolt , who have returned from their mission to recover Jetfire . Optimus thanks Silverbolt and welcomes him into the Ark , where the rest of the Aerialbots are finished being repaired. As they come online, the Aerialbots excitedly embrace Optimus. Wheeljack then informs Optimus that he's set up a diagnostic table to examine Prime's visions, as Thundercracker observes them from behind Teletraan-1 .

On Cybertron , Shredhead talks with Cliffjumper , who is worried about Carly . Cliffjumper asks Shredhead if they recognize him, and Shredhead says that while their memories are hazy, they do feel a connection from the sparks that made them. When Cliffjumper tells Shredhead about his concerns for the human that painted the mural on the side of Shredhead's alternate mode, they enthusiastically transform and suggest the pair go rescue her.

Meanwhile, the Decepticons have reconvened on the fragment of Cybertron that fell into the Pacific Ocean . Megatron reveals that this particular part of their world housed the Beacon of The Ancient , and that he hid raw materials here during the war. He orders Starscream brought before him and, using the technology available, fully restores the damaged Seeker . Starscream grovels before Megatron in thanks before Megatron proceeds to beat him once more within an inch of his life. He then orders Astrotrain be brought in and transforms into his gun mode. Though Starscream tries to resist, Megatron's will overpowers him and he blasts Astrotrain to smithereens, though this task requires Starscream to unload shot after shot, as Megatron's incomplete state means his gun mode lacks its usual firepower. After transforming back into robot mode, Megatron tells the Autobots to prepare themselves, because he's coming to make himself whole again...

## Synopsis

Ultra Magnus awakens in the depths of the United States military facility he's being kept in. The only person around is Carl "Doc" Greer , whom Magnus tentatively greets, to Doc's surprise. The two converse for a bit before the conversation is interrupted by the arrival of General Flagg with some sort of machine. Doc asks the general what he plans to do to Magnus, stating he's essentially a prisoner of war, but Flagg ignores his protests as he activates the machine. As the machine begins to whirr, Magnus pleads for them to stop.

On Cybertron , Elita One checks in with Bluestreak and Warpath as they work to repair Shockwave 's space bridge , hoping to return to Earth and bring back Optimus Prime . However, because of the damage to the Nemesis side, the portal will require quadruple the Energon necessary to transport all of them; they only have enough to send one Autobot back. Elita goes to Cliffjumper and Shredhead , as the little red bot tells the newly born warrior about his friend Carly .

Back on Earth, the Decepticons prepare to launch an assault on the Ark . Inside the Autobot base, Wheeljack is examining Optimus, trying to figure out why the Matrix of Leadership hasn't recharged at all since its last use. As he looks over the scans, he deduces the cause to be some sort of infection coming from Megatron 's arm. However, their examination is interrupted by the Decepticons' attack. The Autobots return fire with the aid of the Ark' s weaponry, managing to even keep the bickering combiners Bruticus and Devastator at bay. As the two sides duke it out, Thundercracker emerges from his hiding place within the Ark and connects to the console where Skywarp resides.

The corruptive power of Megatron's arm grows on Optimus, to the point where he involuntarily turns his fusion cannon on Jazz . However, before he can do anything, Skywarp's teleportation ability activates, teleporting the entire ship to parts unknown and sending the Autobots falling into the caverns of the mountain left behind. The Decepticons converge on the Autobots, but they are saved by the timely intervention of the Aerialbots , who combine into Superion to take on Bruticus and Devastator. As the Autobots try to recover, Optimus realizes what Megatron's arm is doing to him; however, he is unable to remove it himself. He pleads with his troops to shoot it off of him before it is too late, orders they reluctantly follow, wounding their leader in the process. The Autobots then attempt to flee on the back of Superion. Megatron, having regained his lost appendage, transforms into his gun mode and uses Starscream to blast Superion, ripping Slingshot from the gestalt and instantly killing him. The Autobots are forced to leave him behind as they fly away. Megatron tells the Decepticons to prepare for conquest.

# Transformers (2023) issue 22

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_22 -->

## Synopsis

Gravely wounded by the blast from Megatron , Superion and the Autobots crash back down to Earth , with Optimus Prime in particular falling unconscious. Exhausted and struggling to stay moving, all hope seems lost until the arrival of Doctor Lio and the residents of Farmingham . After all that the Autobots have done to help and protect them, the community has now come together to help them, loading the injured Autobots onto several tractor trailers.

On Cybertron , Elita One reveals to Cliffjumper that they have repaired Shockwave 's portal to Earth, but that they only have enough power to send back one individual. To his surprise, Elita has chosen Cliffjumper to be that bot. Cliff asks about Shredhead , but Elita believes their power will be better served helping them take Cybertron back from the Decepticons . She leaves to allow Cliffjumper to say his goodbyes to Shredhead, but Cliffjumper tells Shredhead to say hello to Carly for him before pushing them through the portal instead. As the portal overloads and explodes, a furious Elita orders Bluestreak to put Cliffjumper in chains, calling him a traitor.

As the Autobots arrive in Farmingham, Prime awakens. He is immediately concerned that their presence will put the humans in danger, but both Wheeljack and Lio insist that they need their help right now. Lio brings Optimus to one of the tents they've set up outside the Farmingham Hospital , revealing that the Coast Guard found the body of Ratchet in the Pacific Ocean . Optimus takes a moment to mourn his lost friend, but then keels over in pain, the Matrix of Leadership flying out of his chest. When Spike asks what's wrong, Wheeljack reveals that Prime's spark is going out, with the infection from Megatron's arm blocking his connection to the Matrix and preventing the artifact from being able to recharge. Believing this to be the end, Optimus asks that one of the other Autobots take the Matrix and his place as leader. However, he looks over to see Spike reaching his hand into the Matrix, just as Sparky did before. Spike then reaches his other hand out to touch Optimus's. Their eyes both glow bright blue with energy… and Optimus finds himself awakening in the Hall of the Primes !

Meanwhile, Megatron and Soundwave pursue the Autobots through the woods, coming across the site where Optimus first noticed Earth's beauty. Megatron discovers where Optimus had buried a dead deer. Megatron mocks Prime's soft heartedness, though admits that he understands his admiration for the Earth, for it reminds him of how glorious Cybertron was before the war led to its destruction. Crushing the remains of the deer, Megatron orders the search be called off. The Decepticons then mobilize for the attack, launching an assault on a number of nearby aircraft carriers just as the United States military prepares their own attack. The human soldiers are easily dispatched by Starscream wielding Megatron and the combined might of Bruticus and Devastator , who have turned the slaughter of humanity into a competition.

Inside the secret facility, General Flagg interrogates Carly, trying to figure out what she knows about the Transformers , but Carly is unable to offer anything useful. Meanwhile, Ultra Magnus continues to be examined and tortured by the facility's scientists, but Doc has had enough of this and decides to help Magnus, deactivating the machines and freeing Magnus from his restraints. Magnus tears through the facility and grabs both Doc and Carly as he escapes. Flagg orders the soldiers to stop him, but their weapons are ineffectual. Once they are far enough away, Magnus lets Doc out of his chest cab. He asks Doc why he freed him, leading Doc to reveal that he was once a prisoner of war like him, tortured in the process. Magnus asks how he is able to go on living after that, but Doc simply says that he has people that need him. He has to keep going for their sake. His words give Magnus a renewed sense of purpose, and he transforms and rolls out to rejoin the people who need him.

In Farmingham, Optimus and Spike are still connected via the Matrix, both unconscious as though in a dream-like state. However, they have to find some way to transport them both, as the United States government has ordered all residents to head east towards Chicago , where they plan to make their final stand against the Decepticons.

## Synopsis

In the middle of the Pacific Ocean , Shredhead reconstitutes from the shattered remains of the Nemesis ' portal. After a brief moment to gather their bearings, Shredhead leaves to find Carly .

Meanwhile, in the war-torn city of Chicago , Trailbreaker , Wheeljack , and Arcee are fending off an assault from Starscream as they try to get citizens from the city's north side to safety. Once that's been accomplished, Arcee advises that the Autobots make some distance, knowing that the Decepticons are after Optimus ' head. At the suggestion of Silverbolt , Wheeljack has the Autobots relocate to the Adler Planetarium . Megatron bears witness to all this from afar, and berates Starscream for ruining an ambush that's been in the works for a week when he returns to his leader's side. Soundwave confirms that the United States military forces defending the city have been successfully obliterated, and asks if they should continue slaughtering humans to break the Autobots' morale, but Megatron declines — the time has come for the Decepticons to move in, and for Optimus to learn his most important lesson...

Within the Matrix of Leadership , Optimus wanders through the Hall of the Primes in search of wisdom. However, all he finds is an infestation of purple tendrils that latch onto him, causing his visions to re-emerge. He's quickly re-awoken by the unexpected appearance of Sparky , who tells Optimus to transform and follow his lead.

The Autobots' respite within the Adler Planetarium is interrupted by the beginning of the Decepticons' assault. With the end nigh, Wheeljack tells the still-comatose Optimus that he tried making him a new arm, but even if he somehow woke up, he's not sure it'd even work. Doctor Lio interrupts to allow the many refugees that've gathered in the Planetarium to pay their respects to their hero, and as people from the likes of Seattle and Tacoma say their pieces, Carly suddenly arrives with Ultra Magnus . Magnus remarks that he'd wanted to be the kind of leader Optimus was ever since he first came to know of him, but despite being outwardly strong, he lacks the bravery and leadership skills needed. Nevertheless, he's prepared to die for Optimus' dream of a better world, and Magnus' words rally the other Autobots. And so, as Beachcomber keeps watch from the back lines, the Autobots and Decepticons charge into battle.

In the Hall of the Primes, Optimus asks Sparky how long he'd been in there, but all he can recall is waking up and seeing Optimus being attacked right after. The tendrils latch onto Optimus again, triggering a memory of Bumblebee 's body lying dead aboard the Ark . Sparky remarks that the two's memories seem to be mixed-up as he makes a hard turn to de-entangle Optimus, replacing Optimus' memory with one of Sparky playing catch with a younger Spike . Though Optimus is keen on seeing what the Primes have to show him, Sparky observes that whatever's infesting the Matrix has already claimed everything... except, that is, for a monument to Sparky himself, for reasons even the man himself can't explain.

With the Autobots' front line broken, Starscream disobeys Megatron and swoops in to eliminate Optimus, Spike, and Carly. Beachcomber flings himself in the way of Starscream's blasts, but despite reassuring Carly that he's fine, another shot from Starscream takes him down, seemingly for good...

Arriving at Sparky's monument, Optimus and Sparky open the doors to find Spike's body partway through a blue portal shaped like the Matrix's core. Optimus informs Sparky of his son's attempted sacrifice, a gesture that touches the old veteran. Sparky puts Spike's hand to his face, and as Optimus recalls the deceased friends he's failed, Sparky muses on the nature of the Matrix's infection: whatever it is, it wants Optimus to surrender to nihilism and block the world around him, just as Sparky did, but it was thanks to Optimus' belief in a better world that Sparky was able to move past it all. To save both Optimus and his son, Sparky gently pushes Spike back through the portal, causing a wave of energy that dissipates the purple tendrils. As the world fades around them, Sparky makes Optimus promise to be there for his son, and Optimus says he'll do it with his entire being.

In the waking world, Starscream prepares to eliminate Carly and the still-comatose Optimus and Spike, only for Megatron to catch up with him and start beating him senseless, intending to do more to Optimus than give him a quick, violent end. Upon noticing the crowd of refugees, Megatron decides to dispose of them... only for Optimus to wake up and warn Megatron that they're under his protection. The Decepticons are prepared to engage, but Megatron orders them to stand down as he removes his fusion cannon — this battle is between him and Optimus. Megatron tosses his weapon aside, Optimus puts Carly and Spike on a nearby pile of rubble, and the two rivals' ultimate showdown begins...

## Synopsis

Optimus Prime and Megatron clash in a furious exchange of unrelenting blows. Optimus affirms that even though he cares for the innocent, that won't stop him from giving Megatron the beating he deserves. However, Megatron quickly turns that around on him and begins targeting the civilians in the area, taunting Prime that he's never been able to make the hard choices that were necessary to save Cybertron . He whales on Prime all the while, rendering him nearly unconscious. Starscream congratulates the Decepticon leader on his victory, but Megatron is not yet finished. Megatron transforms into gun mode and orders Starscream to drop Optimus onto a set of antennae atop a skyscraper, impaling Prime and keeping him stationary as Megatron prepares his final lesson. Starscream then collects Spike , Carly , and Beachcomber and brings them before Optimus. Megatron presents his mortal enemy with an ultimatum: choose which he will execute, his human friends or the pure-hearted Autobot . Optimus refuses to play this sick game, but Megatron says that if he doesn't choose, he will simply kill them both! Beachcomber begs Optimus to choose him, but still Prime rejects the idea. Under the influence of Megatron, Starscream aims at Spike and Carly, ready to pull Megatron's trigger...

But he hesitates, as Omega Supreme glides silently overhead. Optimus and Starscream both look up in awe at the ancient Transformer, who looks down and waves at Starscream — just as he did millennia ago . Starscream, speechless, waves back. As Omega flies off, Megatron orders Starscream to obey his will. However, seeing Omega has reminded the Seeker of his true name: Ulchtar.

Turning Megatron's gun mode on himself, Ulchtar blasts himself in the head as Megatron cries out in fury and returns to robot mode. As Ulchtar's body falls to the ground below, Megatron turns his fusion cannon on Carly and Spike, who are saved by the timely intervention of Shredhead , who tells Carly — noticeably surprised to see her van is now a Transformer — that Cliffjumper says hello, before slicing through the antenna that pins Optimus in place. Megatron begs Optimus to stop, but the Autobot leader has lost any patience with his enemy, pulling the remaining antenna from his torso and using it to knock Megatron off the skyscraper. His body is caught by Devastator , and he orders the Decepticons to retreat.

Still reeling from the battle, Optimus holds Spike in his hands, relieved to see that the boy is okay. As Optimus, Spike, Carly, and Beachcomber collect themselves in the aftermath, Carly notices that the light in the Matrix of Leadership has returned, with Prime realizing that he has been cured of Megatron's infection. Carly remarks on how small the light is... but as Optimus looks over the dark and destroyed remnants of Chicago , he tells her that it is small, but still mighty.

## Synopsis

Megatron is not happy. Badly injured from his defeat at the hands of Optimus Prime and forced to retreat to the sunken Nemesis , he berates the Decepticons for their failure, to the point of physically hurling Devastator to the ground, sending the Constructicons flying apart. But the bot that earns the most of his scorn is Starscream , whose mangled body he orders thrown in with the rest of the dead Decepticons. Megatron then reminds the Decepticons that their ultimate goal is achieving peace for the good of all Cybertronians — peace through tyranny. Unable to return to Cybertron , Megatron asks his soldiers if they will be strong enough to accomplish their goals here on Earth . Each one answers in the affirmative, and together they begin to chant, "all hail Megatron!" As the chorus rings out across the ship, Starscream's eye lights up red once more.

In Chicago , the Autobots are helping clean up the damage from their battle with the Decepticons. Optimus is sorrowful at seeing the devastation his war brought to humanity until he is approached by a little girl wearing a face mask. She tells him that she was scared of him before, but isn't anymore; she knows he's not a bad robot like "those other ones." Optimus tells her he doesn't believe anything can be truly bad, only misguided. As Ultra Magnus clears rubble away, Arcee senses he is unwell. Much like Optimus, Magnus despairs at the destruction, believing it should have been his duty to prevent it. Arcee and Jazz assure him that they all did as much as they could. Beachcomber then alerts them to a signal coming from beneath a pile of rubble. As they move to help whoever is trapped, Soundwave bursts free! Optimus immediately moves to engage, ordering the other Autobots to evacuate and protect the humans. Soundwave asks where Megatron is, but does not believe Optimus when he says Megatron fled. The two exchange blows, but Optimus quickly finishes the fight by slamming Soundwave to the ground. He orders Wheeljack to restrain the Decepticon and take him to their base, Magnus accompanying him. Optimus is then greeted by General Flagg . Flagg says that they've figured the Autobots must be "the good ones" and is here to offer Prime a partnership with the United States government , believing they could help each other. Prime takes full responsibility for bringing the Decepticons to Earth and that the Autobots do not need anything from the humans in exchange for fighting them. Still, Flagg insists Optimus accompany him back to his base, saying he has some things he'd like to show him.

Wheeljack, Magnus, and Jazz take Soundwave to what constitutes their "base": the cavern in the mountain where the Ark used to be. Wheeljack ventures inside the cave to explore, coming across the skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex . As he goes to examine the fossils, the cave starts to shake. In an instant, Wheeljack is inside the Ark , the ship having teleported back to its exact same spot once more, much to the Autobots' confusion. Magnus and Jazz join him inside and place Soundwave in the brig. Jazz and Wheeljack wonder where the ship could have gone when they are attacked by Thundercracker ! The Decepticon Seeker is panicked, desperately wanting to know where he just was, claiming to have seen monsters like he'd never seen before !

Optimus Prime is airlifted to a United States military base. There, General Flagg continues his discussion with Prime, underscoring the importance of their working together to stop the Decepticons and offering Prime any resources the Autobots might need. He then leads Optimus to a secret underground facility called " Shadow Watch ," where Prime discovers the deactivated bodies of Mirage and Bulkhead . Flagg tells Optimus that both were found some decades ago and brought here to be studied, but that they were unable to revive either of them, suggesting Optimus might be able to. Optimus laments that they don't have the Energon to do so, but that's when Flagg reveals his other gift: a massive cache of Energon crystals that Shadow Watch has been stockpiling over the years. Prime and Flagg are then greeted by the head of Shadow Watch... a man named Miles Mayhem .

Back on Cybertron, Elita One has gathered her troops. She is still furious at Cliffjumper for sending Shredhead to Earth, but has reluctantly allowed him out of prison since they can't spare anymore troops. Bluestreak tries to advocate for Cliff wanting to help Optimus, but Elita shuts him down. Optimus Prime abandoned them, so now Elita is done. As far as she is concerned, Optimus Prime is their enemy!

# Transformers (2023) issue 26

<!-- Source: https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_26 -->

## Synopsis

Thundercracker wildly opens fire on Jazz and Wheeljack , still panicking after his experience in Cobra-La and screaming "DEATH TO THE AUTOBOTS!" He tries to remove Skywarp from Teletraan-1 , but both Skywarp and the Autobots warn him that doing so will kill Skywarp. Thankfully, his rampage is halted by Ultra Magnus , who rips the incendiary guns off his arms. Thundercracker blames the Autobots for Skywarp's condition, not believing them when they say they lacked the capability to undo what Starscream and Soundwave did. However, Optimus Prime then returns, accompanied by General Flagg and his supply of Energon .

Recognizing that Thundercracker still has some nobility in him, Optimus tells the Seeker that they will use their new resources to repair Skywarp. Magnus is concerned about showing this level of mercy to a Decepticon , but Optimus insists they have to find common ground as Cybertronians if they are to have any hope of ending the war. Flagg commends Optimus on his conflict resolution skills, and Optimus introduces the rest of the Autobots to their new human ally. Wheeljack is initially wary of the General, but is thankful upon seeing the recovered bodies of Mirage and Bulkhead . As the two discuss the rebuilding efforts in Chicago , Wheeljack proposes that - with enough resources - he could build the city into something brand new, with state of the art defense capabilities, an offer Flagg readily accepts.

Some time later, Wheeljack reports that he should be able to get Teletraan working again, offering to repair Optimus once he's done, but Optimus insists they start repairs with those who need them most, in this case Skywarp (despite objections from Wheeljack and Magnus, both still uneasy at the presence of Thundercracker). Optimus then shares some of their Energon with the imprisoned Soundwave, but the reception of his kindness is far chillier than Thundercracker's. Optimus questions why Soundwave would remain so loyal to the Decepticons after they abandoned him, but ultimately leaves his prisoner to his Energon.

In Chicago, the Autobots are still aiding in cleanup alongside Carly and Spike . Shredhead especially proves impressive to their new friends, managing to help Beachcomber save a group of humans out from under some heavy debris. Meanwhile, at Shadow Watch , Miles Mayhem examines the 3D scans that they took of Optimus Prime during his visit to their underground base. This will allow them to study the Transformer 's transformation . Mayhem asks the technician if he's shared this with General Flagg, believing the fewer people who know about this, the better. When the technician confirms Flagg doesn't, Mayhem pulls out a pistol and shoots him.

On Cybertron , Elita One tasks Cliffjumper with venturing into Decepticon territory to recover the components of Shockwave 's space bridge . She sees it as an opportunity to redeem himself for his betrayal, but Cliffjumper insists he did the right thing to help Earth . Elita is tired of hearing about Earth, instead focusing on the plight of their fellow Autobots, many of whom lay in stasis lock around their base.

On the Ark , Wheeljack has finished his repairs to both Teletraan and Skywarp. The Decepticon teleporter seems confused, but when Optimus tries to explain what happened, he attacks the Autobot leader. Wheeljack desperately tries to shield Teletraan from any stray blasts while Thundercracker tries to get his fellow Seeker to stop. However, it is to no avail, as Skywarp transforms and flies through the ship to escape. He comes across Soundwave, who tells him to return to the Decepticons and alert Megatron . Thundercracker tries to talk Skywarp down, reminding him that it was their fellow Decepticons that mutilated Skywarp in the first place, but Skywarp insists that it was just desperation, and that things will return to normal with Megatron back. But Thundercracker refuses to go back, and so Skywarp simply transforms and flies away.

Aboard the Nemesis , Scrapper and Rumble have scoured the seafloor and found what little bits of Energon they could, bringing it before Megatron. Their leader is disappointed, as such a pittance is barely enough for his own repairs, let alone their entire forces. Scrapper suggests that they could overtake human energy generation and use that to create more Energon, but his suggestion is interrupted when Megatron falls to his knees, shrieking. The other Decepticons can do little else but look on as Megatron grabs his head in pain, his eyes glowing purple...
